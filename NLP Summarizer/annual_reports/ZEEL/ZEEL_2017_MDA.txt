ndia remains one of the fastest growing economies 
in the world despite the temporary slowdown in 
growth due to government’s decision to withdraw high 
denomination notes from circulation. High frequency 
data, such as automobile sales, cement consumption, 
personal loan growth and exports growth suggest that 
the economy is gradually recovering from the impact 
of demonetisation. RBI expects real GDP growth to 
accelerate to 7.3% in FY18 from 6.6% in FY17 (GVA 
basis). Sustained low inﬂation, falling ﬁscal deﬁcit, low 
current account deﬁcit, and a stable currency have 
created a positive environment for economic growth. 
Goods and Services Tax (GST) is expected to be 
implemented in India in FY18. This uniﬁed tax regime, 
coupled with the Central Government’s thrust on areas, 
such as power, infrastructure, and affordable housing 
should help accelerate India’s growth rate closer to 8% in 
the medium term.
India’s consumption growth over the past decade has 
been strong and resilient even during periods of slower 
GDP growth. This bodes well for our industry, as spends 
on media and entertainment are linked to consumption 
spends in the economy. Private ﬁnal consumption is 
estimated to have grown at 6.8% CAGR over FY12-
17 in real terms (12.5% in nominal terms). Within the 
consumption basket, the share of non-food items has 
been rising with increasing per capita income. There is 
another positive trend of organised businesses entering 
and gaining market share in various sectors. Both these 
factors bode well for growth in advertising spends.
T
he media and entertainment industry (M&E) 
witnessed another year of all round growth, 
albeit slower than estimates at the start of the 
ﬁnancial year. This was mainly due to the impact of 
demonetisation. According to FICCI-KPMG estimates, 
India’s M&E industry grew at 9.1% in CY16 over 
the previous year, to ` 1,262 billion. On average, an 
Indian consumer spends much less time and share of 
his disposable income on media and entertainment 
consumption, compared to peers and developed 
countries. This provides a signiﬁcant headroom for 
sustained growth which will be driven by rising disposable 
incomes and increasing avenues of entertainment.  
FICCI-KMPG industry report pegs the growth of Indian 
M&E industry over the next ﬁve years at 13.9% CAGR, to  
` 2,419 billion.
In the year gone by, within the television segment, 
regional channels continued to gain traction. Print, unlike 
in the developed world, continued to grow, with vernacular 
outpacing the growth of English language publications. In 
the movie industry, although overall revenues declined, 
box ofﬁce collections of blockbuster ﬁlms surpassed all 
previous records. This was true for Bollywood as well as 
regional ﬁlms. Video consumption on digital platforms 
got a boost due to decline in data tariffs and increased 
availability of content on various digital platforms. Radio 
made deeper inroads in semi-urban India following the 
auction of Phase III licenses.

elevision industry’s growth in FY17 saw a temporary blip 
because of demonetisation and delay in digitisation of 
analogue cable subscriber base. However, towards the end 
of the year, advertising growth returned to normalcy. After multiple 
extensions of deadline, digitisation of Phase III cable subscriber 
base was largely completed. Despite these adversities, as per the 
FICCI-KPMG industry report, Indian television segment registered 
a growth of 8.5% in CY16 as compared to 14.2% in CY15.
Television remains the prime medium of entertainment for the 
Indian consumer. During FY17, time spent on watching television 
at individual and household levels stood at 158 and 287 minutes 
per day respectively, which remained stable through the year. 
During the year, there was an increase in viewership of news 
channels due to signiﬁcant events, such as surgical strikes, 
state elections and demonetisation. Hindi GEC remains the most 
watched genre in the country. Meanwhile, regional channels 
continued to gain traction.
The deadline for digitisation of Phase III and IV were postponed 
again to January 2017 and March 2017, respectively. On the 
positive side, digitisation of Phase III is now almost complete. 
Despite the deadline for phase IV having elapsed, the pace of 
digitisation in those areas remains slow due to its geographical 
spread. Both, broadcasters and distributors, are focused on 
improving monetisation of subscribers in newly digitised markets. 
In India, pay television ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) is 
signiﬁcantly lower than comparable countries. Completion of the 
digitisation process could set the ball rolling for long overdue 
correction of Indian television ARPU.

A TO ZEE OF CONTENT LEADERSHIP
During the year, Telecom Regulatory Authority of 
India (TRAI) issued tariff order with the objective 
of allowing viewers to choose channels on an a-la-
carte basis. This order has been challenged by multiple 
stakeholders and the matter is subjudice. Effective 
implementation of this tariff order requires a signiﬁcant 
upgrade of infrastructure and subscriber management 
systems of the distributors. It might be difﬁcult to offer 
channels on a-la-carte basis, given low ARPU in India. As 
a result, bouquet may remain the most popular option for 
subscription even under the new regulation. 
Broadcast Audience Research Council’s (BARC)
television universe expanded from 674 million individuals 
and 153 million households to 780 million individuals and 
183 million households in FY17. It is in the process of 
increasing panel size from 22,000 meters to over 30,000 
by the end of CY17. The measurement of rural audience 
has provided valuable insights into the viewership 
patterns and preferences of vast rural television 
households. 
Growth outlook for the Indian television segment is 
strong across both advertising and subscription revenue 
streams. Strong consumption growth, coupled with 
increasing share of organised businesses in various 
segments, augurs well for the growth in advertising 
spends. On account of its reach and impact, television 
will continue to remain the preferred advertising medium 
for brands. Digitisation, increasing penetration of high 
deﬁnition and a growing base of television households will 
drive subscription revenues. FICCI-KPMG report forecasts 
Indian television segment to grow at a CAGR of 14.7% 
over CY16-21, driven by 14.4% growth in advertising 
revenues and 14.8% growth in subscription revenues.   
ZEEL has a strong presence in all entertainment genres 
in both national and regional markets through a bouquet 
of 32 channels. During FY17, the Company’s pan-India 
viewership share was 16.0%.

FOR MOVIE INDUSTRY 
REVENUE GROWTH
IN INDIA, MOBILE

OF ONLINE VIDEO 
CONSUMPTION
I
ndia is the world’s largest market in terms of movies 
released annually but ranks ﬁfth in terms of revenues. 
Although movie-going is a well-entrenched leisure 
habit in India, its monetisation is low due to smaller ticket 
size and low screen penetration. However, the scenario 
is improving, with multiplexes increasing its share at 
the expense of single screens, driving up average ticket 
prices. Satellite and digital rights are additional sources 
of revenue for the movies. While the market for satellite 
rights remains healthy, digital rights saw a sharp increase 
in price due to competition from multiple players. 
While the South Indian ﬁlm industry continues its strong 
growth, other regional markets such as Marathi, Gujarati 
and Punjabi are also gaining traction. For instance, 
Sairat, a Marathi movie, grossed more than ` 1 billion in 
theatrical revenues, a ﬁrst for a Marathi movie. The Indian 
movie industry is estimated to grow at 7.7% CAGR during 
CY16-21 to around ` 207 billion. 
Zee Studios, ZEEL’s ﬁlm production and distribution arm, 
is well positioned to gain from these market dynamics. It 
produces Bollywood as well as regional language ﬁlms in 
Marathi, Kannada, Telugu and Punjabi.
D
uring the year, the ecosystem for digital 
consumption of entertainment content evolved at 
a fast pace. In India, mobile is the primary device 
for internet access. According to estimates, India’s 3G 
and 4G subscriber base stood at 250 million at the end 
of FY17, and is likely to reach 470 million by 2020. The 
launch of Reliance Jio and acceleration in 4G rollout by 
other telecom players has signiﬁcantly improved data 
connectivity. Over the past few years, there has been a 
spurt in the number of OTT service providers, with both 
the local as well as foreign players vying for consumers’ 
attention. OTT players are also investing in producing 
original content for digital platforms, including digital only 
or digital ﬁrst content. 
Rollout of 4G networks and the ﬁerce competition in 
the telecom sector has led to a sharp decline in data 
rates. Online consumption of video content has surged 
on the back of these developments and the trend is 
likely to continue. Despite the drop, because of low 
pay television ARPU, the total cost of watching video 
online still compares unfavourably with television. Low 
penetration of wired broadband is another limiting factor 
for wider adoption of online entertainment. As broadband 
availability and affordability improves further, the growth 
in online video consumption will accelerate. Ad spends on 
digital media is growing at an impressive pace, partially 
driven by ‘search’ and ‘banner’ advertising. The  
FICCI-KPMG report shows that digital advertising in India 
grew by 28% in CY16 to ` 77 billion, and is expected to 
grow at a CAGR of 30.8% over CY16-21. 
ZEEL has a strong presence in the digital space through 
its two OTT platforms – dittoTV, which is a subscription-
based video on demand (SVOD) platform, and OZEE, 
which is an advertising video on demand (AVOD) platform.

ndian music market is set to more than double to ` 25 
billion by CY21. Music labels’ revenues are derived from 
multiple sources, such as online music streaming, airing 
on radio, and use of audio tracks for various purposes. 
With the onset of digital revolution, music consumption on 
digital platforms has become the primary driver of growth 
for the industry. It now contributes to over 70% of the 
total revenues. Online streaming platforms already have 
over 50 million users which will continue to grow on the 
back of falling data cost and availability of curated music. 
Like the trend in movies, music consumption in regional 
languages is also gaining traction.
Zee Music Company, ZEEL’s music publishing label, has 
a signiﬁcant presence in Bollywood music as well as 
regional music.

T
he live events industry in India is largely 
unorganised. Traditionally, India has not been a big 
market for ticketed live events, but the space is now 
witnessing a strong growth. It could further accelerate if 
issues such as lack of infrastructure, skilled manpower, 
and multiple taxes are resolved. As per the FICCI-KPMG 
report, live entertainment industry in India grew at  
20-25%, with an estimated revenue of ` 55-65 billion  
in CY16.

D
omestic Broadcasting is ZEEL’s largest business 
division comprising 32 channels across four 
categories - Hindi GECs, Hindi Movie Cluster, 
Regional Entertainment Channels and Niche Channels. 
During FY17, the domestic broadcasting business 
continued to perform strongly. ZEEL had a network 
viewership share of 16.0% and was the second largest 
player in the Indian television entertainment business. 
The performance was led by a good performance of the 
regional portfolio and Hindi movie cluster.  
The year was also marked by multiple decisions 
that reﬂect the Company’s commitment to continue 
investments for growth and to further strengthen its  
competitive position. 
KEY HIGHLIGHTS
DIVESTMENT OF THE SPORTS BUSINESS
The Company’s sports business - Ten Sports Network, 
was divested through a sale to Sony Pictures Network 
for USD 385 million. The decision to sell the business 
was a culmination of strategic review of the portfolio. 
The Company invested in and grew the sports business 
over the last 10 years with the expectation of turning it 
proﬁtable. However, the gestation period continued to 
get elongated as monetisation of sporting events did not 
improve as expected. Meanwhile, the cost of broadcasting 
rights of relevant sporting events continued to escalate. 
ACQUISITION OF RBNL’S BROADCASTING PORTFOLIO
ZEEL agreed to acquire the television broadcasting 
portfolio of Reliance Broadcast Networks Limited (RBNL), 
which comprises of two channels - Big Magic and Big 
Ganga. These acquisitions dovetail into ZEEL’s well 
established strategy of regionalisation and segmentation. 
The acquisition offers multiple synergies with the existing 
offerings of ZEEL. Big Magic complements the existing 
Hindi GECs through the addition of comedy genre, and 
Big Ganga opens up the attractive Bhojpuri market for the 
Company. 
PORTFOLIO EXPANSION
The Company launched 3 channels and decided to take 2 
channels off-air. 
 
Zee Yuva, launched in August 2016, is a youth 
focused Marathi channel that caters to contemporary 
audiences and will help the Company consolidate its 
leadership position in the language. 
 
Zee Anmol Cinema, launched in September 2016, 
builds on the leadership of hindi movie cluster by 
adding an FTA property. The channel will allow 
consumers to sample premium content and graduate 
to a paid model over a period. 
 
Zee Cinemalu, was launched in September 2016 
for the movie loving Telugu audience. The channel 
leverages a library of over 500 titles across genres to 
cater to the preferences of a diverse set of audiences.
 
Considering the viewer preference for content on 
Zindagi and ZeeQ, the Company decided to shut 
down linear feed of these channels. The content of 
these two channels is available on Company’s 
online platform.

STRENGTHENING THE MOVIE LIBRARY
During the year, the Company signiﬁcantly increased its 
investments in acquisition of movie rights including future 
rights and rights of movies under production. Movies is 
one of the most important entertainment genres for Indian 
consumers and a key long-term growth driver for the 
business. ZEEL now has a portfolio of 11 movie channels 
across Hindi and regional languages. Movies also form an 
integral part of content strategy for general entertainment 
channels across languages.
PREMIUMISATION OF PORTFOLIO
With the improving penetration of HD television sets, 
audience increasingly wants to consume content in high 
deﬁnition. During the year, the Company expanded its HD 
offerings with the launch of HD feeds for Zee Marathi, 
Zee Talkies and Zee Bangla. HD channels offer a richer 
viewing experience to consumers and higher ARPU to the 
Company. ZEEL will continue to increase its HD offerings 
going forward. 
CLUSTER WISE OPERATIONAL REVIEW
HINDI GEC
The Hindi GEC bouquet contains 4 channels - Zee TV is 
the ﬂagship channel, &tv is the Company’s second GEC 
targeted at younger and urban audience, Zee Anmol is the 
FTA Channel and Zing focuses on the youth audience.  
Zee TV is one of the leading Hindi GECs in India. While 
the channel began the year on a strong note, it witnessed 
a dip in its viewership during the later half. The channel 
has put together a new content line up to win back share 
of eyeballs which has started yielding results. 
&tv continued to build its viewership in urban markets 
and has launched several shows that are designed to help 
increase audience stickiness and attract new viewers.  
Zee Anmol was the leader in the FTA genre during the 
year, and Zing maintained its position amongst the top 
two channels in the youth genre with a mix of music and 
Bollywood shows.
HINDI MOVIE CLUSTER
ZEEL’s Hindi Movies bouquet, comprising 7 channels (Zee 
Cinema, &pictures, Zee Classic, Zee Action, Zee Anmol 
Cinema, Zee Cinema HD and &pictures HD), continued 
to consolidate its leadership position during the year. 
Besides performing well on library titles, the channels also 
aired world television premieres of hit Bollywood movies, 
such as Welcome Back, Rustom, Flying Jatt, Baaghi, 
Tamasha and Baar Baar Dekho.
REGIONAL ENTERTAINMENT CHANNELS
ZEEL’s regional portfolio caters to 6 linguistically diverse 
markets - Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and 
Odiya. Completion of acquisition of RBNL’s Broadcasting 
business will add Bhojpuri language to the portfolio. 
Regional GECs continued their strong performance and 
strengthened their competitive position in respective 
markets. 
Zee Marathi strengthened its leadership and was the  
No.1 channel across all prime-time slots. Zee Yuva was 
launched this year with impressive numbers – it became 
the third highest channel by reach within six months of 
its launch. Zee Talkies continued to be the top movie 
destination for Marathi audience. 
Zee Bangla maintained its No. 2 position during the 
year. While consolidating its urban reach, the channel 
also took steps to increase its rural viewer base, which 
demonstrated results.  Zee Bangla Cinema improved  
its viewership share as the No. 2 movie channel helped 
by the high viewership of Zee Bangla Cinema Originals 
movies.
Zee Kannada established itself as the clear No. 2 
channel, and recorded its highest viewership ever, with an 
increase of 40% in ratings compared to last year.
Zee Telugu was the No. 3 channel in the market. 
However, it maintained its leadership in the primetime 
slots. Zee Cinemalu made an impressive debut and 
became the third most watched Telugu movie channel 
within six months of launch. 
Zee Tamil increased its viewership share by 300% and 
became the No. 2 channel. The channel has lined up 
multiple launches which are likely to provide an impetus 
to the viewership numbers.
Sarthak TV (Odiya) continued to remain the leading 
channel by a distance, being a leader across most of the 
prime-time slots. 
NICHE CHANNELS
Zee Café remained one of the top English entertainment 
channels, with its rich and diverse content spread. Zee 
Studio, with its top-of-line Hollywood content, continued 
to be one of the preferred English movie channels across 
the genre. Zindagi, through its thought leadership, aired 
some of the most compelling stories from culturally 
diverse regions such as Turkey, South Korea, Ukraine 
and more. However, considering the preference of the 
viewers for this channel, the Company decided to move 
its content to the online platform.

the Company to improve its 
viewership and monetisation 
of movies. Understanding from 
these businesses is used in

ZEE STUDIOS
During the year, Zee Studios released 
seven movies across three languages.  
Zee Studios has adopted a strategy of 
focusing on Hindi and regional movies, 
which allows it to leverage its expertise in 
making content in several languages.

SCRIPT DRIVEN
Movie selection at Zee Studios 
starts with identifying thought 
provoking story-lines and does 
not revolve around star cast. 
For instance, Sairat featured 
two unknown faces but still 
managed to attract audience 
on the back of a strong 
story. Zee Studios’ complete 
involvement in movie making 
sets its business model apart 
from several other studios. This 
gives the Company a strong 
grip over story-line, execution 
and costs. 
ACROSS BUDGETS, 
ACROSS LANGUAGES
The Company does not believe 
that the success of a movie is 
contingent on the budget. A 
good story rather than budget 
is a pre-requisite for selection 
of a movie. Producing movies 
across different budgets also 
reduces the risk. Leveraging 
its experience of entertaining 
viewers across languages, the 
Company makes movies in 
multiple languages. A portfolio 
of movies across budgets and 
languages reduces inherent 
risk in the business. 
PROFIT-SHARING WITH 
KEY TALENT
Talent is a signiﬁcant 
proportion of the movie 
cost in India and in many 
cases, this high cost could 
be the difference between 
a proﬁtable and a loss 
making movie. The Company 
works on the principle that 
if a movie is successful, all 
stakeholders should make 
money. Accordingly, it tries 
to engage the talent on a 
proﬁt sharing basis. This also 
reduces ﬁnancial impact of 
unsuccessful movies.

INDUSTRY RISK
EVER-CHANGING TRENDS IN MEDIA SECTOR
Audience tastes are constantly evolving and difﬁcult to predict with 
accuracy. People’s tastes vary quite rapidly along with the trends and 
environment they live in. This makes it virtually impossible to predict 
whether a particular content would do well or not. With the kind of 
investments made in ventures, repeated non-performance of the shows 
would have an adverse impact on the bottom-line of the Company.
SLOWDOWN IN DTH / DIGITAL ROLLOUT
The uptake of pay digital services by subscribers has been a very 
encouraging sign for all broadcasters. Contrary to the global trends, in 
India, the under-declaration in the analogue cable system has led the 
broadcasters to be more dependent on advertising revenues, which 
tend to be cyclical in nature and more affected by the macroeconomic 
factors. Completion of rollout of Phase I and Phase II cities took longer 
than expected. Phase III rollout is currently underway. It may take longer 
to realise revenues from Phase III and Phase IV cities as their rollouts may 
not be completed on time.
COMPETITION FROM OTHER BROADCASTERSS
The Company operates in a highly competitive environment that is subject 
to innovations, changes and varying levels of resources available to each 
broadcaster in each segment of business. The GEC genre is amongst the 
key genres for all advertisers and hence is most lucrative to all the TV 
broadcasters. Any new competition in the space can have an impact on 
the Company’s revenues.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISK
MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Macroeconomic environment can be a potential source of risk. 
Moderating growth, along with high inﬂation, can adversely impact 
advertising revenues of the Company, which forms it’s the largest 
component of revenues.
THE COMPANY MAY BE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS
The Company receives a signiﬁcant portion of its revenues and incurs 
a signiﬁcant portion of its expenses in foreign currencies, particularly 
US dollars and UK pounds. Accordingly, the Company is exposed to 
ﬂuctuations in the exchange rates between those currencies and the 
Rupee, which is the Company’s reporting currency. This may have a 
substantial impact on its revenues and expenses.
SLUGGISH CONSUMER UPTAKE IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
ZEE has been a pioneer in the international markets and has the highest 
market share amongst all South Asian broadcasters across Europe and 
USA. Indian content in these markets serves the preference of a niche 
audience and ZEE has strong relations with distribution platforms in 
these markets. This gives the Company the conﬁdence that it will retain 
market share in key geographies. Given the global economic slowdown, 
consumers may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to upgrade their packages, and hence 
value growth from these markets may get affected.
REGULATORY RISK
UNCERTAINTY IN RULES & REGULATIONS
The M&E industry is governed by the rules and regulations framed by the 
Ministry of Information & Broadcasting as well as industry bodies such 
as TRAI. The rules such as price regulation have a direct bearing on the 
revenue potential of the Company. The existing as well as future rules and 
regulations can impact the ﬁnancial performance of the Company.
COST OF PROGRAMMING MIX MIGHT AFFECT THE COMPANY’S BOTTOM-LINE
The Company always strives to have a competitive edge by providing 
viewers the best possible content. ZEE would have to incur high 
expenditure to provide an impetus on its programming and content from 
time to time. The resulting increase in costs might not necessarily perk up 
its revenues proportionately.
INVESTMENTS IN NEW CHANNELS
The Company may from time to time launch new channels. Content for 
these channels is either created or acquired. The success of any new 
channel depends on various factors, including the quality of programming, 
price, extent of marketing, competition etc. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be as successful in launching new channels as it 
has been in the case of its existing channels.
INCREASE IN COST OF CONTENT ACQUISITION
The Company spends a signiﬁcant amount for acquisition of rights to 
telecast sporting events, movies and music rights, and library content 
rights. Any future contracts may be at higher costs, which may put 
pressure on the Company’s margins.
