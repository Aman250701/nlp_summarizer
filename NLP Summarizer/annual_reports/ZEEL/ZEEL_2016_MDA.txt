MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INDIAN MACROECONOMIC SCENARIO
India is one of the few shining spots on an otherwise gloomy global economic map. While 
most of the global economies did not fare well in the past year, the process of economic 
recovery in India continued with the GDP growth being one of the highest in the world. 
Renewed industrial activity, sustained low crude oil prices, favorable business sentiments, 
easing interest rates have spurred the economic growth. The government’s promise to stick 
to the fiscal deficit target for the current year and reduce it for the next year bodes well for 
the Indian economy. Indian GDP grew at 7.3% for FY16 and is projected to grow at 7.5% 
in the next fiscal year. 
MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY 
The Media and Entertainment Industry is a key growth driver for the Indian economy. 
According to the FICCI-KPMG Report 2016, the sector witnessed 12.8% growth in 2015 
growing from INR 1,026 billion in 2014 to INR 1,157 billion in 2015. The industry is 
expected to grow to INR 2,260 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 14.3% during 2015-2020, 
which is more than double the rate of growth of global M&E Industry. 
Total advertising spend across different media verticals was INR 475 billion in 2015 
contributing to 41% of the total Media & Entertainment industry revenues. Fueled by 
the continued economic growth, advertising revenues saw a growth of 14.7% in 2015. 
Currently, advertising revenue in India contributes less than 0.5% of the GDP, compared 
to the average 1% contribution across most developed economies. It is expected that 
advertising will increasingly contribute a higher share to the GDP in the coming years 
and is projected to double to INR 994 billion by 2020 growing at a CAGR of 16% during 
2015-2020.
In 2015, subscription revenues grew at annualized growth rate 11.4%, from INR 612 billion 
in 2014 to INR 682 billion in 2015. With the effects of cable digitization yet to show impact, 
the subscription revenue is expected to grow to INR 1,266 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 
13.2% during 2015-2020. 
TELEVISION
Television forms the core of the Indian M&E Industry contributing to around 47% of the 
overall revenue of the industry. Television sector grew from INR 475 billion in 2014 to INR 
542 billion in 2015, registering a growth of 14%. The growth was driven by a strong 17% 
rise in advertising spend. The sector is projected to more than double its revenues to INR 
1098 billion by 2020 growing at a CAGR of 15% for 2015-2020. (Source: FICCI-KPMG 
Indian Media and Entertainment Industry Report 2016). 
FY16 saw the commencement of digitization of DAS III cities. Digitization is expected to give 
the consumer better control in terms of the subscription choices. It will also lead to increase 
in the ARPU and subsequently increase in broadcasters’ share of subscription revenues.
Another major milestone for the television industry was the launch of new TV audience 
measurement system from BARC(Broadcast Audience Research Council) India in April 
2015. BARC has started with a sample size of 22,000 homes and will gradually increase 
it to 50,000 over the next few years further improving the quality of data. The data was 
rolled out in phase wise manner with the launch of rural data in October 2015 completing 
the process. Inclusion of rural ratings has given the broadcasters as well as the advertiser 
insights into the hitherto unknown rural market.
CURRENTLY, ADVERTISING REVENUE IN INDIA CONTRIBUTES 
LESS THAN 0.5% OF THE GDP, COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE 1% 
CONTRIBUTION ACROSS MOST DEVELOPED ECONOMIES.

FILMS
The Film sector grew by 9.3% to INR 138 billion in 2015 from INR 126 billion in 2014, 
mainly driven by Regional and Hollywood cinema. Growth of Regional and Hollywood 
content points to the trend of audience appreciating the quality of the content irrespective 
of the language.
India is still under penetrated in terms of screens which means there is a huge scope 
of growth for the film industry. With the proliferation of multiplex screens coupled with 
technology to conveniently book tickets the footfalls are expected to increase. Growing 
popularity of VOD services has opened up a new revenue stream for films. The Film 
sector is projected to grow to INR 227 billion by the end of 2020 at a CAGR of 10.5% for  
2015-2020. 
Essel Vision, ZEE’s content production and distribution arm produced its first Hindi Movie, 
‘Jazbaa’ which was the comeback movie of Aishwarya Rai. The company also produced 
and distributed a number of blockbuster and hit Marathi movies like ‘Natsamrat’, ‘Katyar 
Kaljat Ghusli’, ‘Double Seat’, ‘Killa’ and ‘Timepass 2’ last year. 
MUSIC
Music industry grew by 10% % to INR 10.8 billion in 2015 compared to INR 9.8 billion 
in 2014. More than 55% of the music industry revenue comes from the digital platforms 
with music streaming services catching the imagination of Indian consumer. The music 
industry is projected to grow to INR 20.6 billion by the end of 2020 at a CAGR of 13.8% 
from 2015-2020.

the leading music producers in the country. The company boasts a wide catalogue of Hindi 
and regional music like Singh is Bliing, Drishyam, Bahubali, Bang Bang, Bombay Velvet etc. 
DIGITAL 
The consumption of content on digital platforms has been increasing gradually. Digital 
advertising grew 38% compared to 2014 to reach INR 60 billion. It is expected that digital 
advertising will continue its strong growth and will grow to INR 255 billion by 2020 at a 
CAGR of 33.5% for 2015-2020. Digital advertising is projected to double its share and 
will contribute over a quarter of the revenue of the total advertising revenue. Currently non 
video advertising contributes to three quarters of the share of digital advertising revenue.
India lags the rest of the world in terms of content consumption on the internet due to 
bandwidth constraints and high data charges. Most of the internet expansion in India 
will be led by mobile connectivity.  The trend of content consumption on the small screen 
will increase gradually as the smartphone penetration increases and is expected to be 
complement TV viewing.
Realizing that the digital medium is going to be a frontier of growth in future, the company 
launched OZEE last year in addition to existing DittoTV. While DittoTV is a SVOD platform 
which offers content from ZEE and other broadcasters, OZEE is an AVOD one stop 
destination for all ZEE content. Both the platforms have managed to find traction in the 
crowded OTT space. The company has also started producing content exclusively for these 
platforms which will find resonance with the digital consumers.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
The key elements of ZEE’s strategy during the year were (i) to take appropriate steps to 
safeguard its leadership position in a fiercely competitive environment (ii) to concentrate 
on additional revenues from traditional and non-traditional platforms (iii) Build presence on 
new / alternate media platforms (iv) Prudent investments and rationalized cost structures 
(v) Fortify its expansion in the international markets (vi) maintain consistently high standards 
of corporate governance.
(I)  APPROPRIATE STEPS TO SAFEGUARD ITS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN A FIERCELY COMPETITIVE 
ENVIRONMENT:
 
 The competition in Indian media industry remains intense. TV broadcasting is 
the largest segment of the industry and the biggest segment of operations for the 
Company. New platforms like online media are also gaining currency. The Company 
has continued to maintain and gain share in the highly competitive TV market through 
the launch of new channels, new shows across network channels, tie up of sporting 
rights etc. In addition to this, the Company aims to further grow its share in the media 
& entertainment pie through enhanced online, movies, music and live events
(II)  CONCENTRATE ON ADDITIONAL REVENUES FROM TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL PLATFORMS:
 
 In the new age of multiple consumption avenues and platforms the requirements of 
advertisers are evolving. Owing to the Company’s strong presence across various 
platforms viz. TV, Online, Music, Movies, Live Events, Sports etc it is crucial to tap 
into the monetization opportunities available across the entire bouquet. The initiative 
to launch Zee Unimedia this fiscal is a step in this direction where in a seamlessly 
integrated solution would be available to serve advertisers’ requirements
(III)  BUILD PRESENCE ON NEW / ALTERNATE MEDIA PLATFORMS:
 
 In line with developments across the world, consumption patterns in India are evolving. 
The complex nature of the Indian market, where preferences vary dramatically across 
regions and demographies the ability to deliver superior quality content is important. 
The Company has always been at the forefront of predicting the evolving customer 
tastes and be ready to serve the market when the opportunity arrives. Thus, in addition 
to Ditto TV which was launched in 2012, the Company consolidated its online presence 
through the launch of OZEE, with an aim to offer On Demand Video Content to 
consumers on multiple platforms including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops 
and connected TVs.
(IV)  PRUDENT INVESTMENTS AND RATIONALIZED COST STRUCTURES:
 
 The belief at the Company has always been that higher spends will not necessarily 
result in sustained incremental content consumption. Even in the wake of competition, 
the network has maintained its like to like cost structures. Better negotiations with 
suppliers and stricter control on distribution spends will help in further keeping costs 
under check. Additionally, the Company has made incremental investments to increase 
its strength across newer business segments like Music and Movie Production. 
(V) FORTIFY ITS EXPANSION IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS:
 
 During the year, the Company undertook various initiatives to further strengthen its 
dominance in international markets by entering into deals with new platform operators 
as well as launching new channels which are dubbed and subtitled in the local 
language for local population in some of the geographies. In line with this expansion 
strategy, the company launched Zee Magic in Africa last year.
(VI)  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE:
 
 ZEE firmly believes that good governance is critical to sustaining corporate 
development, increasing productivity and competitiveness and creating shareholder 
wealth. The governance process should ensure that the available resources are utilized 
in a manner that meets the aspirations of all its stakeholders. Your Company’s essential 
charter is shaped by the objectives of transparency, professionalism and accountability. 
The Company continuously endeavors to improve on these aspects on an ongoing 
basis. While the increasing emphasis on transparency and accountability, standards 
have been set by various governing bodies on disclosure as well as judiciousness in 
conduct. ZEE has always tried to go a step further in this direction.
THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE INDIAN MARKET, WHERE 
PREFERENCES VARY DRAMATICALLY ACROSS REGIONS AND 
DEMOGRAPHIES THE ABILITY TO DELIVER SUPERIOR QUALITY 
CONTENT IS IMPORTANT. THE COMPANY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
AT THE FOREFRONT OF PREDICTING THE EVOLVING CUSTOMER 
TASTES AND READY TO SERVE THE MARKET WHEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY ARRIVES.

ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16
RISK FACTORS
EXTERNAL RISK FACTORS
 
Industry Risk
 
 
Ever changing trends in Media sector:
 
 
 
 Audience tastes are constantly evolving and difficult to predict with accuracy. 
People’s tastes vary quite rapidly along with the trends and environment they 
live in. This makes it virtually impossible to predict whether a particular show 
or serial would do well or not. With the kind of investments made in ventures, 
repeated non-performance of the shows would have an adverse impact on 
the bottom line of the Company.
 
 
Slowdown in DTH/Digital rollout:
 
 
 
 The uptake of pay digital services by subscribers has been a very encouraging 
sign for all broadcasters. Contrary to the global trends, in India the under-
declaration in the analogue cable system has led to broadcasters being more 
dependent on advertising revenues, which tend to be cyclical in nature and 
more affected by the macro economic factors. Completion of rollout of Phase 
I and Phase II cities took longer than expected. Phase III rollout is currently 
underway. It may take longer to realize revenues from Phase III and Phase IV 
cities as their rollouts may not be completed on time.
 
 
Competition from other players:
 
 
 
 The Company operates in highly competitive environment that is subject to 
innovations, changes and varying levels of resources available to each player 
in each segment of business. The GEC genre is amongst the key genres for 
all advertisers and hence is most lucrative to all the TV broadcasters. Any new 
competition in the space can have an impact on the Company’s revenues.
 
Environment Risk
 
 
Macroeconomic environment:
 
 
 
 Macroeconomic environment can be a potential source of risk. Moderating 
growth, along with high inflation, can adversely impact advertising revenues 
of the Company, which forms the largest component of the Company’s 
revenues.
 
 
The Company may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations:
 
 
 
 The Company receives a significant portion of its revenues and incurs a 
significant portion of its expenses in foreign currencies, particularly US dollars 
and UK pounds. Accordingly, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in the 
exchange rates between those currencies and the Rupee, the Company’s 
reporting currency, which may have a substantial impact on its revenues and 
expenses.
 
 
Sluggish consumer uptake in the international markets:
 
 
 
 ZEE has been a pioneer in the international markets and has the highest 
market share amongst all South Asian broadcasters across Europe and USA. 
Indian content in these markets serves the preference of a niche audience 
and ZEE has strong relations with distribution platforms in these markets 
giving management the confidence that the Company will retain market share 
in key geographies. Given the global economic slowdown, consumers may 
find it difficult to upgrade their packages and the value growth from these 
markets may get affected.
 
Regulatory Risk
 
 
Uncertainty in rules & regulations:
 
 
 
 The M&E industry is governed by the rules and regulations framed by the 
Ministry of Information & Broadcasting as well as industry bodies such as 
TRAI. The rules such as price regulation have a direct bearing on the revenue 
potential of the company. The existing as well as future rules and regulations 
can impact the financial performance of the company.
INTERNAL RISK FACTORS
 
Cost of programming mix might affect its bottom line:
 
 
 The urge to compete and provide the best content to viewers, ZEE would have to 
incur high expenditure to provide an impetus on its programming front from time 
to time. The increase in costs might not necessarily perk up its revenues in the 
same proportion.
 
Investments in new channels:
 
 
 The Company may from time to time launch new channels. Content for these 
channels is either created or acquired. The success of any new channel depends 
on various factors, including the quality of programming, price, extent of 
marketing, competition etc. There can be no assurance that the Company will be 
as successful in launching new channels as it has been the case of its existing 
channels.
 
Increase in cost of content acquisition:
 
 
 The company spends a significant amount for acquisition of rights to telecast 
sporting events, movies and music rights and library content rights. Any future 
contracts may be at higher costs, which may put pressure on margins of the 
Company.
