Zee Network dominates the International South Asian (SA) Business globally. Zee TV 
continues its dominant position in US, Middle East & Africa in terms of viewership within the 
SA channels. During the year, the Company undertook various initiatives to further strengthen 
its dominance in the geographies where it operates.
Key highlights during the year include:
 
In US, Zee channels were added onto additional platforms like Charter
 
Zee celebrated 20 years of its presence in UK and Europe market
 
&TV was launched in the UK market
 
 Zee World, our first dubbed English GEC with Indian content for mainstream African 
viewers was launched in Africa
 
Zee Cinema International was launched in Africa.
 
Zee Tamil and Zee Khana Khazana were launched in the Indian Ocean Islands.
 
 Zee TV continued to be the Number 1 South Asian channel both in terms of GRPs and 
Reach in the UAE.
 
 Zee TV launched Parwaaz, a drama series that was entirely produced in the UAE. This 
show broke all viewership records in the UAE among south Asians.
 
 Zee Aflam consolidated its position as the top Bollywood channel catering to Arabic 
audiences.
 
 Zee Alwan continues to grow its reach in the market with shows like Jodha Akbar, 
Qubool and Rihlet Saloni S3 (Saath Phere - Season 3).
 
 ZEE launched a GEC, Zee Hiburan, in Indonesia, which is fully dubbed and subtitled in 
Bahasa language.
 
 Zee Nung was launched in Thailand which is a 24/7 Bollywood movie channel localized 
and packaged in Thai language.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
The key elements of ZEE’s strategy during the year were
(i) 
 to invest in growth opportunities to safeguard business leadership in a competitive 
environment
(ii) to concentrate on additional revenues from digitization
(iii) Rationalize on costs across different heads
(iv) Fortify its expansion in the international markets
(v) Maintain consistently high standards of corporate governance
(i)   Invest in growth opportunities to safeguard business leadership in a competitive 
environment:
 
 In FY2015, ZEE launched two Hindi GECs - Zindagi and &tv, to further enhance market 
share through a planned content lineup. The launch of new shows across network 
channels along with the tie up of cricket rights and other major sporting events has 
helped ensure that in a highly fragmented environment, the network grew its dominance.
(ii) Concentrate on additional revenues from digitization:
 
 India is a fast digitizing market and the consumer shift towards digital services is 
exhibited through the rampant expansion of digitized households. The completion of 
the digitization process in Phase I and Phase II cities and the rollout in Phase III and 
Phase IV cities is seen as a positive step that should lead to a boost in the subscription 
revenues in the future.
(iii) Rationalize on costs across different heads
 
 The belief at the Company has always been that higher spends may not necessarily 
result in sustained incremental viewership. The network continues to endeavor towards 
maintaining its cost structures through better negotiations with suppliers and better 
control on distribution spends.
Zee TV continues 
its dominant 
position in US, 
Middle East & 
Africa in terms of 
viewership within 
the SA channels.

(iv) Fortify its expansion in the international markets:
 
 During the year, the Company undertook various initiatives to further strengthen its 
dominance in international markets by entering into deals with new platform operators 
as well as launching new channels in some of the geographies. In line with this 
expansion strategy, the company launched Zee World, Zee Nung and Zee Hiburan in 
various geographies.
(v) Corporate Governance:
 
 ZEE firmly believes that good governance is critical to sustaining corporate development, 
increasing productivity and competitiveness and creating shareholder wealth. The 
governance process should ensure that the available resources are utilized in a manner 
that meets the aspirations of all of its stakeholders. The Company’s essential charter 
is shaped by the objectives of transparency, professionalism and accountability. The 
Company continuously endeavors to improve on these aspects on an ongoing basis. 
While the increasing emphasis on transparency and accountability, standards have been 
set by various governing bodies on disclosure as well as judiciousness in conduct, ZEE 
has always tried to go a step further in this direction.
RISK FACTORS
Competition from other players
The Company operates in highly competitive environment that is subject to innovations, 
changes and varying levels of resources available to each player in each segment of 
business.
Ever changing trends in Media sector
It may not be possible to consistently predict changing audience tastes. People’s tastes vary 
quite rapidly along with the trends and environment they live in. In this makes it is virtually 
impossible to predict whether a particular show or serial would do well or not. With the kind 
of investments made in ventures, repeated failures would have an adverse impact on the 
bottom line of the Company.
Cost of programming mix might affect its bottom line
The urge to compete and provide the best content to viewers, ZEE would have to incur high 
expenditure to provide an impetus on its programming front from time to time. The increase 
in costs might not necessarily perk up its revenues in the same proportion.
Investments in new channels
The Company may from time to time launch new channels like we did with Zindagi and &tv 
this year. Content for these channels is either freshly created or acquired. The success of any 
new channel depends on various factors, including the quality of programming, price, extent 
of marketing, competition etc. There can be no assurance that the Company will be as 
successful in launching new channels as it has been the case of its existing channels.
Macroeconomic environment
Macroeconomic environment can be a potential source of risk. Moderating growth, along 
with high inflation, can adversely impact advertising revenues of the Company, which forms 
the largest component of the Company’s revenues.
Slowdown in DTH/Digital rollout
The uptake of pay digital services by subscribers has been a very encouraging sign for all 
broadcasters. Internationally most broadcasters derive a greater share of their revenues 
from the subscription revenues whereas in India the under-declaration in the analogue cable 
system has led to broadcasters being more dependent on advertising revenues, which tend 
to be cyclical in nature and more affected by the macro economic factors. The rollout of 
109
Annual Report 2014-15
management discussion and analysis
Phase I and Phase II cities took longer than expected. Similarly, it may take longer to realize 
revenues from Phase III and Phase IV cities as their rollouts may not be completed on time.
Increased competitive environment in the Hindi General Entertainment Space
The Hindi GEC genre is amongst the key genres for all advertisers and hence is most 
lucrative to all the TV broadcasters. Even though we launched Zindagi and &tv this year, any 
new competition in the Hindi GEC space can have an impact on the Company’s revenues.
Sluggish consumer uptake in the international markets
ZEE has been a pioneer in the international markets and has the highest market share 
amongst all South East Asian broadcasters across Europe and USA. Indian content in 
these markets serves the preference of a niche audience and ZEE has strong relations 
with distribution platforms in these markets giving management the confidence that the 
Company will retain market share in key geographies. Given the global economic slowdown, 
consumers may find it difficult to upgrade their packages and the value growth from these 
markets may get affected.
Increase in cost of acquisition for some of the key sports properties
While a significant amount of rights have been signed on by the Company for leading sports 
properties, any future contracts may be at higher costs, which may put pressure on margins 
of the Company.
The Company may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
The Company receives a significant portion of its revenues and incurs a significant portion of 
its expenses in foreign currencies, particularly US Dollars and UK Pounds. Accordingly, the 
Company is exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between those currencies and the 
Indian Rupee; the Company’s reporting currency, which may have an impact on its revenues 
and expenses.
