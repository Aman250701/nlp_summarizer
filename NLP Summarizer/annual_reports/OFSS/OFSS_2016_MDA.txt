of financial condition and results of operations
Technology trends in the financial services industry
Banks the world over are facing sweeping changes in customer expectations and are having to deal with disruptive fintechs.  
The fintechs are already competing for the banking businesses around the globe. The Fintechs typically adopt a customer engagement 
model that lowers entry barriers; with fewer clicks and steps they deliver the services to their customers within minutes with a very 
sharp and narrow focus. This has helped them to build scale and be super-efficient. Also their business and customer engagement is 
data driven and gives better insights and context of the transaction. They have the ability to use data from both within and outside 
their business. Their entire business and technology is designed with a service orientation and systems that are lean and leverage the 
deployments on the cloud.
Today’s technologies offer more choices than ever before. More banks are building the digital experience and digital engagement 
capabilities and are deploying them progressively. Your Company is focused on delivering the ability to achieve significant 
improvements to modernize in stages, starting with the elements that make the most sense for the bank’s business scenario. Also, 
it enables a two-speed delivery for renewing the customer facing capabilities rapidly, taking advantage of newer technologies, while 
mitigating the risk and ring fencing the more pervasive components to prevent business disruption. Your Company helps banks 
build and deliver superior value to the entire customer relationship.
For Financial Institutions, managing their data has become increasingly complex. Chief financial officers, chief risk officers, chief 
compliance officers, chief marketing officers, and now the newly appointed chief data officers, are looking at the data from the 
same sources for different purposes. By addressing them individually, financial institutions are facing significant effort for the non-
discretionary work across disciplines in their enterprise. Your Company is bringing it all together, for all the players as they all have 
common data requirements. From the experience of working with some of the larger banks, your Company finds 70% of data for 
AML can be reused for Basel computations thereby lowering the time and effort to manage data for multiple stakeholders in the 
enterprise.
The financial services industry participants increasingly need modeling and predictive analytics. For this, the data model should be 
extensible and support Data Lakes. Your Company’s foundation approach for data with purpose-built analytical applications that 
are extensible and address the evolving data management challenges.

non-transferable and royalty free.

We provide consulting services to our customers. The customer is typically charged a service fee on either a fixed price basis or 
a time and material basis based on the professional efforts incurred and associated out of pocket expenses. Both PrimeSourcing

Foreign currency and treasury operations
A substantial portion of our revenues is generated in foreign currencies while a majority of our expenses are incurred in 
Indian Rupees (INR), with the remaining expenses are incurred in US Dollars (USD), Euro (EUR), Australian Dollars (AUD),  
Singapore Dollars (SGD), British Pounds (GBP), and other foreign currencies. We cover the foreign currency exposure through 
forward contracts as per our treasury management policy.
We follow a conservative philosophy for our treasury. The surplus funds are invested predominantly in time deposits with Indian 
and foreign banks with high credit rating within limits on exposure to any one particular bank.
Opportunities and threats
We believe our strengths as a leader in technology innovation are our comprehensive and compelling suite of applications for digital 
and data transformation at Financial Institutions. We strive to stay ahead of the competition through continuous research and 
development, which is a major spend for us. We have rich experience in delivering transformation projects around the globe and 
have built a robust business model with high operating leverage. Our unique global customer footprint enables expand the market 
in multiple segments.
Technology and customer are driving a major change in the industry and this throws up new opportunities due to:
– 
New investments driven by key trends such as digital, big data analytics
– 
Evolving regulatory reporting and compliance requirements driving IT spend at Financial Institutions
– 
Opportunities with new players in the FSI marketplace (fintechs, new brands)
– 
Progressive transformation at Tier 1 Financial Institutions and migration to the Cloud

The opportunities also throw up newer challenges due to:
– 
Increase external demand for our key talent leading to attrition
– 
Frequently changing regulations in the area of international mobility
– 
Competition from newer players
Liquidity and capital resources
Our capital requirement relate primarily to financing the growth of our business. We have historically financed the majority of our 
working capital, capital expenditure and other requirements through our operating cash flow. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we 
generated cash from operations of ` 7,142.81 million and ` 10,603.91 million respectively as per consolidated results and ` 7,384.42 
million and ` 9,743.53 million respectively as per unconsolidated results.
We are a zero debt Company. We expect that our primary financing requirements in the future will be capital expenditure and 
working capital requirements in connection with the expansion of our business. We believe that the cash generated from operations 
will be sufficient to satisfy our currently foreseeable capital expenditure and working capital requirements.
Human capital
We recruit graduates and post-graduates from top engineering and business schools. We also hire domain experts from the banking 
industry creating a right mix of employees with functional and technology expertise. We invest in their continuous learning and

employees unique. Our professionally rewarding work environment helps create an engaged team. Our performance and talent 
management programs inculcate a culture of rewarding merit and encourages formal talent development by enhancing the necessary 
skills and competencies. This ensures that our employees continuously deliver value to the organization and our customers. Our 
success comes from an inclusive and collaborative team which works together and also has a healthy degree of mutual respect and 
bonds of friendship. Octane, our employee club initiative, encourages sports and creative talents to build a connect and camaraderie 
that goes beyond the workspace.

the fiscal year ended March 2016 as compared to 7,151 as on March 2015.
Risks and concerns
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our primary market risk exposures are due to the following:
– 
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations
– 
Fluctuations in interest rates
As of March 31, 2016, we had Cash and Bank Balances of ` 27,307.39 million out of which ` 21,872.47 million was in interest 
bearing bank deposits as per consolidated financials and ` 21,736.83 million, out of which ` 20,373.38 million was in interest bearing 
bank deposits as per unconsolidated financials. Consequently, we face an exposure on account of fluctuation in interest rates. These 
funds were mainly invested in bank deposits of longer maturity (more than 90 days and under 360 days).
A substantial portion of our revenues is generated in foreign currencies, while a majority of our expenses are incurred in Indian 
Rupees and the balance in US Dollars, Australian Dollars, British Pound, Euro and other currencies. Our functional currency 
for Indian operations is the Indian Rupee. We expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to be generated in foreign 
currencies for the foreseeable future and a significant portion of our expenses, including personnel costs and capital and operating 
expenditure, to continue to be incurred in Indian Rupees.
In addition, we face normal business risks such as global competition and country risks pertaining to countries that we operate in.
