Management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
Technology trends in the financial services industry
Banks the world over are facing sweeping changes and are having to deal with disruptive trends. They face uncertain and weak 
economies in many regions; they have new and non-traditional competitors using innovative technology threatening to take their 
business away; digitization is catching the imagination of a new generation of customers; and their regulatory environment is getting 
more demanding.
The Technology environment today offers more choices than ever before. The Cloud is already proving to be a great leveller by 
dramatically reducing deployment cost and complexity. Technology advances in the area of big data have the potential to unlock the 
latent value of the vast storehouse of data that banks own.
We analyze these trends and what banks the world over are doing to navigate through these interesting and rapidly changing times.
Banks are custodian to very large amounts of data generated every day. However, in the past their focus was on transaction processing 
and therefore the data has been fragmented and maintained in silos. In the midst of all the rapid changes within their industry across 
the world, banks find it difficult to effectively integrate data that did not provide a holistic view of their own business, leave alone 
their customers. Even though they were in possession of vast and invaluable amounts of data on each customer, the bedrock of a 
business - the customer and the customer experience - traditionally took a back seat.
But banks are having to change fast. In a world where financial products and their pricing, reviews and delivery are available at 
an instant on mobile devices, banks can no more take their customers or their business for granted. Add to this the changing 
demographic profile of their customers - millennials, who use technology in radically different ways from previous generations. 
These customers are accustomed to receiving information where it matters and in an instant. When their bank is unable to deliver 
the experience they are looking for, this mass segment is likely to move on. In the last couple of years, the banks have been under 
scrutiny by the regulators, and have been ended up paying billions of dollars in fines and penalties. Banks are spending more money, 
energy and time to keep pace and align to the regulations, both current and evolving.
It is against this backdrop that banks are now being forced to rethink their technology strategies. The focus is no more on how much 
information banks possess of their customers, but how intelligently and creatively they can utilize this data to reduce operational 
expenses, improve wallet share, grow by seizing cross-sell opportunities, comply with every changing laws and regulations, and, 
most importantly, deliver a highly engaging customer experience.
Smart banks today are marrying big data and digital technologies to create a unique experience for their customers. The analytics 
improve the ability to mine the customer data to create relevant offerings while at the same time reducing the risk and cost of 
reaching the customer. From being positioned as supporting multiple channels, banks are shifting focus to delivering channel 
agnostic digital experiences that are insight-driven. As the mobile revolution ushers in a new way of thinking, traditional banks are 
stepping up to offer the complete range of banking products and services. The main goals of the banks are to service customers 
better, reduce operational costs, increase revenue streams and provide the convenience of "anywhere, anytime, any device" banking.
Digital remains a significant area of focus for us as our products enable progressive transformation to help banks create a strong 
digital presence. With the Millennial customer demanding banks are connected with the digital ecosystem, banks needs to reorient 
themselves to a “customer in” approach that builds sustainable information driven and value centric relationship as opposed to the 
typical “product out” approach.
The second major area of disruption we are seeing is the potential of the "Cloud". With the need to commit a large upfront 
investment eliminated, Cloud offers access to a level playing field for small players to compete effectively with large banks. Even 
large banks are increasingly adopting Cloud based deployment to better manage their investments. Oracle is a leading provider of 
Cloud based services including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
Cloud IT models in banking and financial services have seen rapid adoption. The strategic relationship we have with our customers 
enables us to provide a significant number of deployment options to them, ranging from SaaS deployment for the Oracle Financial 
Services Lending and Leasing, Oracle FLEXCUBE on Managed Cloud Services or as a Business Process Service from a certified 
partner.
Islamic banking is another area where both conventional and pure play Islamic banks are enhancing their portfolio to offer  
Shariah-compliant products and services. Oracle FLEXCUBE for Islamic banking platform is market-leading in its ability to offer 
both conventional and Islamic banking services in a highly flexible, transparent and regulator-compliant manner.
Oracle FLEXCUBE Investor Services is an important asset in our product portfolio. We have several marquee customers across 
the world already, and see the recent trends such as the ‘Asian Funds Passport’ as opportunities that will help us expand our 
footprint further. Moreover, in economically thriving regions of the world the appetite for wealth management solutions and mutual 
funds is steadily growing.

Our product revenues comprise license fees, professional fees for implementation and enhancement services and annual 
maintenance contract (Post Contract Support - PCS) fees for our products.
License fee
Our standard licensing arrangements for products provide the bank a right to use the product up to a limit on number of users 
or sites or such other usage metric upon the payment of a license fee. The license fee is a function of a variety of quantitative 
and qualitative factors, including the number of copies sold, the number of users supported, the number and combination of the 
modules sold and the number of sites and geographical locations supported. The licenses are perpetual, non-exclusive, personal, 
non-transferable and royalty free.
Consulting fee
Along with licenses for our products, our customers can also optionally avail consulting services related to the implementation 
of products at their sites, integration with other systems or enhancements to address their specific requirements. The customer is 
typically charged a service fee on either a fixed price basis or a time and material basis based on the professional efforts incurred and 
associated out of pocket expenses.
Annual maintenance contract (PCS) fees
Customers typically sign an Annual Maintenance Contract with us under which, we provide technical support, maintenance, problem 
resolution and upgrades for the licensed products. These support agreements typically cover a period of 12 months.
The revenues generated from license fees and consulting services rendered by us depends on factors such as the number of new 
customers added, milestones achieved, implementation time, etc. Therefore, such revenues typically vary from year to year. The 
annual maintenance contracts generate steady revenues and would grow to the extent that new customers are entering a support 
agreement.
