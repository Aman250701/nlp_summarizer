Management’s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations
Technology trends in the financial services industry
Financial service institutions today face a significantly altered competitive landscape and must respond faster to changing market 
requirements. Many institutions have invested in innovation, including setting up ‘innovation labs’ and a convergence is emerging 
between technology and financial services with significant implications for their traditional ecosystem. The rise of fintechs has 
increased competition for banks, but it has also created an opportunity for incumbents to partner with new market entrants, leverage 
new technologies and build an environment that fosters innovation and is capable of meeting changing customer expectations.
This emerging collaboration between banks and fintechs is paving the way for a new sharing economy, one that is underpinned 
by accelerating digitization. New digital platforms and devices are introduced into the consumer market almost every day and 
digitization is permeating every aspect of business. With a plethora of options banks are struggling to determine their best way 
forward. There is a need to digitally engage with partners, suppliers, investors, and employees in addition to customers. Banks 
are rethinking their strategy based not just on technology but with a larger vision of what digital innovation and engagement 
means to their business. This has paved the era of a hyper connected ecosystem and the need for platforms that can support 
financial institutions to successfully navigate the challenges they face. Oracle Financial Services’ prescribed strategy for Digital 
Transformation is to recompose a bank’s architecture with digital engagement capabilities to become the new “banking core”. Such 
a strategy re-energizes key areas of a bank’s operations resulting in customer delight.
A new paradigm is on the rise where banks could be the center of a shared economy operating in a complex ecosystem of partners 
and third parties to provide financial services. This model is marked by open infrastructures and the assimilation of products from 
competitors and financial technology companies into a bank’s own offerings. Banks can be in a unique position where they no 
longer have to create or push products out but establish themselves as platform providers allowing partners to create and consume 
value. Financial institutions have the opportunity to earn revenue from their well established banking systems. Your Company 
offers the technology that enables banks with the flexibility to open up their systems to third-party applications and provide the kind 
of product customization and experience that customers expect.
Another major area of disruption is the Cloud. Already conferring enormous benefits around cost, agility, and customer experience, 
cloud computing is transforming business practices and reshaping IT. Beyond that, it is also changing the way organizations 
compete, as the number of solutions and use cases continue to grow. Oracle is the leading provider of Cloud Services globally. 
Oracle Financial Services Managed Cloud Services provide financial institutions with seamless access to Oracle support, product 
and software management experts to deliver fast innovation, increased security, availability, and performance. Your Company’s 
Cloud Services offer complete end-to-end application and production support, eliminating the burden of IT maintenance and 
freeing up funds and talent for business innovation.

License fee
Our standard licensing arrangements for products provide the bank a right to use the product up to a limit on number of users 
or sites or such other usage metric upon the payment of a license fee. The license fee is a function of a variety of quantitative 
and qualitative factors, including the number of copies sold, the number of users supported, the number and combination of the 
modules sold and the number of sites and geographical locations supported. The licenses are perpetual, non-exclusive, personal, 
non-transferable and royalty free.
Annual maintenance contract (PCS) fees
Customers typically sign an Annual Maintenance Contract with us under which, we provide technical support, maintenance, problem 
resolution and upgrades for the licensed products. These support agreements typically cover a period of 12 months.
Consulting fee
We provide consulting services to our customers. The customer is typically charged a service fee on either a fixed price basis or 
a time and material basis based on the professional efforts incurred and associated out of pocket expenses. Both PrimeSourcing 
and BPO businesses comprise only of consulting services. In products business, our customers can optionally avail our consulting 
services related to the implementation of products at their sites, integration with other systems or enhancements to address their 
specific requirements.
The revenues generated from license fees and consulting services rendered by us depends on factors such as the number of new 
customers added, milestones achieved, implementation effort, etc. Therefore, such revenues typically vary from quarter to quarter 
and year to year. The annual maintenance contracts generate steady revenues and would grow to the extent that new customers are 
entering a support agreement.
