India’s competitive advantage lies in its large pool of well-
trained medical professionals and its lower cost of healthcare 
delivery compared to counterparts in Asia and Western 
countries, whereby the cost of some surgeries in India are 
about one-third that of the US and Western Europe.

Management Discussion and Analysis
India has one of the fastest growing 
healthcare markets in the world. Rising 
income levels, an ageing population, 
increasing insurance coverage and the 
imbalance in demand-supply presents 
a big opportunity for healthcare 
providers to increase bed capacity and 
investments in this sector. Healthcare 
has evolved into one of India’s largest 
sectors - both in terms of revenue and 
employment, growing at a high pace 
due to an increasing expenditure by 
the public as well as private players. 
India’s competitive advantage lies in 
its large pool of well-trained medical 
professionals and also its lower cost 
for healthcare delivery compared to 
counterparts in Asia and Western 
countries, whereby the cost of some 
surgeries in India are about one-third 
that of the US and Western Europe. 
From a market size standpoint, the 
global healthcare sector is pegged to 
grow at 4.3% CAGR from 2014-15 to 
touch US$ 8.7 tn in 2019-20. Further, 
the estimates also suggest that the 
Asia-Pacific region which stands to 
gain from a growing middle-class 
income coupled with rising expectancy, 
changing lifestyle and increasing 
accessibility will drive this expansion. 
Indian Healthcare Industry to 
be US$280 bn by 2019-20
Indian Healthcare sector continues 
to grow at a faster pace than that of 
most other countries. The healthcare 
market witnessed an 11.2% CAGR 
over 2009-14 to reach US$ 83 bn, and 
contributes about 4-5% to India’s GDP. 
The industry is projected to grow at a 
CAGR of 23% to US$ 280 bn over 2015-
20E. The growth will be reinforced by 
four major propellers which can be 
termed as 4A’s of Indian healthcare: 
Accessibility, Affordability, Awareness 
and Ailments.
Accessibility: 
 Dearth of tertiary care healthcare 
facilities remains an issue plaguing 
the sector and the population as 
whole
 India has only 7 beds per 10,000 
population which is lower compared 
to global median of 26
Affordability:
 Out of the pocket expenditure 
on healthcare in India is 61% - the 
highest in the world
 India has amongst the lowest health 
insurance penetration among 
the developing countries, < 20% 
population has health insurance 
(0.2-0.3% of GDP) (2013-14) 
Awareness:
 Low literacy levels, primarily in 
rural areas, has been one of the 
major reasons behind the lack of 
awareness of healthcare
 Government campaigns and key 
projects like National Rural Health 
Mission (NRHM) along with NGOs 
are playing a pivotal role to create 
awareness about various diseases 
 Government’s focus on promoting 
AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and 
Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and 
Homeopathy)
Ailments:
 More lifestyle centric disease and 
rising urbanization are leading to 
a drastic increase in deaths due to 
Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs)
 Deaths due to NCDs are expected 
to be 74% of total deaths in 2029-30 
compared to 60% in 2011-12
Rural India which accounts for 
over 70% of the population is set 
to emerge as a potential demand 
source. India requires 600,000 to 
700,000 additional beds over the 
next five to six years, indicative of 
an investment opportunity of US$ 
25-30 bn. Given this investment 
demand, the number of transactions 
in the healthcare space is expected 
to witness an increase in the 
near future. From a penetration 
standpoint, hospitals sector is 
witnessing the rise of Health Cities, 
where Tier-1 cities are turning into a 
one-stop shop for healthcare services 
including wellness, education and 
medical training. Tier-2 cities are 
gaining more traction as the cost  
of setting up hospitals is about  
~50% lower than Tier-1 cities.

These towns are expected to emerge 
as attractive markets due to the 
demography, increasing middle-class 
consumers and lack of adequate 
healthcare facilities. Further, better 
access to these cities owing to 
the development of new national/
international airports have aided in 
the overall connectivity and spread of 
healthcare services to the remotest 
parts of the country.
Some of the key factors in Indian landscape that 
present an opportunity are:
Healthcare Spending, 
Elusive to Poor
Fragmanted 
Penetration
Inadequate 
Infrastructure
Organized vs 
Unorganized 
 India spends far less on 
healthcare as compared to most 
other middle-income countries. 
The total contribution from 
healthcare to GDP is ~4% which 
is among the lowest in the world
 Funding in healthcare is largely 
determined by the increase in 
purchasing power of people
 India has 20% share of global 
disease burden and its share in 
the healthcare infrastructure is 
very low with only 8% share of 
doctor and nursing staff and 6% 
of the world hospital beds
 The doctor-to-patient ratio for 
India, as per the Medical Council 
of India, stands at 1:1,674, well 
below WHO recommendation  
of 1:1,000
 More than 70% of the Indian 
population is residing in the 
rural areas, yet 80% of the 
healthcare facilities locate in 
the cities
 Urban-rural divide is a big 
reason why a majority of the 
population do not have access 
to quality healthcare and 
medical infrastructure
 Indian healthcare system 
has been functioning as an 
unorganized sector, with 
operations conducted by both 
the private and public sector, 
separately
 Need for better structuring of 
hospital norms to overhaul the 
sector from compliance and 
accountabiilty perspective

NH believes that affordability and quality healthcare are not two 
mutually exclusive aspects of healthcare ecosystem and can play 
out in conjunction with each other by deploying a well-crafted 
strategy centred around clinical excellence and optimal utilization 
of capital.
NH strives to develop a healthier, 
disease-free society by providing 
comprehensive, affordable and 
best-in-class healthcare solutions 
to people in every conceivable way. 
The Group firmly believes that India 
deserves an improved healthcare 
system and as a key industry player, 
it aims to spearhead this drive. Thus, 
NH’s purpose, since inception in 2000, 
has been towards building a robust 
affordable healthcare environment. 
Today, it prides itself in making 
substantial progress along these lines. 
NH continues to widen its vibrant 
umbrella by adding new hospitals 
across the network and is committed 
to realise the goal to be a true Pan-
India healthcare provider. NH operates 
a network of 24 hospitals, 7 heart 
centres and 19 primary care facilities 
as of May 1, 2017 (including clinics and 
information centres), across India and 
one hospital at the Cayman Islands 
with 5,932 operational beds and the 
potential to reach a capacity 
of 7,181 beds. 
NH has a strong presence in the 
Southern state of Karnataka and 
Eastern India, as well as an emerging 
presence in the Western, Central and 
Northern India. The Group recently 
added two hospitals in NCR to

operational for more than five years, 
growing by an industry leading 13% 
year-on-year with headroom available 
to maintain the momentum given the 
occupancy level of less than 65% for 
this set. The mature hospitals are well-
complemented by the newer facilities, 
which have completed less than five 
years of operations, whose steady 
ramp-up has ensured 25% year-on-
year growth. It led to an EBITDA of 
` 2,463 mn, which is 30.2% up from 
the reported EBITDA of fiscal 2016 
translating to margin expansion of 
~139 bps over 2015-16 and a stellar 
~350 bps improvement over 2014-15 
highlighting the efficacy of NH’s distinct 
model. There was a brief stutter in 
the second half of the year due to the 
government’s demonetization drive 
which had an impact on the walk-in 
patients which constitute close to 
60% of the group’s revenues. While 
there was some disruption in the cash 
situation, regularity returned to 
the business closer to the end of 
financial year. 
The commendable aspect of 
2016-17 results is an exponential rise 
in Group’s total comprehensive income 
which stood  at ` 830 mn which is 
about 314% higher than the reported 
number for 2015- 16. This phenomenal 
performance is due to the turnaround 
of operations at our Cayman Islands 
Hospital which, through its wide 
spectrum of services, has achieved 
an EBITDA margin of 13.3% in the last 
quarter which translated to an overall 
EBITDA margin of 7.6% for the full year. 
This notable feat by Cayman Islands 
facility was achieved within three years 
of operations. Another crucial highlight 
is our Net Debt to Trailing EBITDA ratio 
as on March 31, 2017 at 0.7 which is 
amongst the lowest in the industry 
demonstrating our fiscal discipline. All 
these heartening developments have 
led to healthy internal accruals for the 
Company with positive free cash flow 
generation. 
Besides the operational performance, 
the year 2016-17 was a landmark 
year for the group concerning 
the accomplishments we had in 
clinical excellence. These initiatives 
demonstrate NH’s commitment to 
patient care and quality services. Some 
of the key highlights:
 Narayana Institute of Cardiac 
Sciences, Bengaluru became the 
first hospital in the country to 
introduce a new smart generation 
catheter device that is used to 
correct electrical signals causing a 
disturbance in the heart rhythm
 Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System, 
installed at NH Health City, crossed 
the milestone of performing around 
150 surgeries within 10 months of 
its commissioning
 Mazumdar Shaw Medical Centre,

marrow from an eight-month-old 
infant to donate it to his sister, first 
of its kind in India 
 The Mysore Hospital performed 
a rare complete hip replacement 
surgery on a 12-year-old boy to treat 
TB of hip
 The Blood Bank at Guwahati 
Hospital got accredited by NABH,

Resources Review 
Our investments in these hospitals 
are on the back of our philosophy to 
expand our presence while maximizing 
the efficiency of capital deployment. 
This apart, we have consciously chosen 
to grow using a judicious mix of organic 
and inorganic growth. On the organic 
route, we started fiscal 2016-17 with 
the commissioning of our super 
speciality facility at Kakriyal, Jammu 
(established in partnership with Shri 
Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board). The 
230 bedded facility is a state-of-the-art 
tertiary care facility catering to patients 
across 20 different specialities with a 
particular focus on cardiac sciences 
and oncology. The response to this 
hospital has been very encouraging 
since the opening, and we see 
meaningful traction to the business. 
Towards the beginning of 2017-18, we 
also commissioned SRCC Children’s 
Hospital at Haji Ali Park, Mahalaxmi in 
Mumbai. The facility is operated and 
managed by NH and backed by SRCC, 
an institution renowned for serving the 
needs of children from all sections of 
society. SRCC Children’s Hospital is our 
maiden foray in Mumbai and a well-
calibrated step in line with our group 
strategy to reinforce our presence 
across selected regional clusters. 
On the inorganic expansion front, 
besides the three facilities acquired in 
2013-14 (one facility at Barasat and two 
facilities in Howrah) to augment our 
stronghold in the Eastern cluster, we 
recently added two additional facilities 
in the Northern region to consolidate 
our presence in the area. This year, we 
ventured into National Capital Region 
(NCR) by entering into a partnership 
to provide healthcare services at 
300 capacity bedded ‘Dharamshila 
Narayana Hospital & Research Centre’ 
in East Delhi. Additionally, we also 
acquired a near complete 230 bedded 
hospital in Gurugram and bolstered 
our presence in the Northern cluster. 
From a geography standpoint, NH has 
sustained its strong brand recognition 
in two geographic clusters in the 
southern state of Karnataka and 
Eastern India, while at the same time 
it has cemented its presence in the 
Western and Northern India.

Our Karnataka cluster comprises 
of seven hospitals including one 
managed hospital and six heart 
centres. Together these facilities 
account for 2,904 capacity beds 
and 2,488 operating beds as on 
May 1, 2017. The cluster accounts 
for over 48% of hospital revenues 
and contributes to 42% hospital 
operational bed count. 
NH has a dominating presence 
in the Karnataka region with 
its business broadly led by NH 
Health City, its flagship facility in 
Bengaluru. NH Health City, located 
in Bommasandra, Bengaluru 
houses Narayana Institute of 
Cardiac Sciences (NICS), a super 
speciality hospital for cardiology 
and cardiac surgery, and 
Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center 
(MSMC), a multispecialty hospital 
for cancer care, neurology and 
neurosurgery, nephrology and 
urology. Along with these two

heart centres across the cluster.
KARNATAKA CLUSTER
NH has charted on a new growth 
phase and lately increased its 
footprints in the western part of 
the country. Our operations in the 
cluster are primarily led by our 
facilities in Jaipur which caters to 
Rajasthan population, a facility in 
Raipur which serves the population 
in and around Chhattisgarh, a 
facility in Ahmedabad and two 
managed units at Palanpur, 
Mahuva in Gujarat. 
To further consolidate our 
presence in the region, we 
identified Mumbai as one of 
the key markets for expansion 
and starting fiscal 2017-18; we 
forayed into Mumbai with our 
distinct SRCC Children’s Hospital 
at Haji Ali Junction in Mumbai. This 
hospital also registers our maiden 
debut as a “pure-play children 
only” hospital. We firmly believe 
that India is an underserved 
market for the children and 
therefore this hospital will 
contribute meaningfully towards 
WESTERN CLUSTER 
the betterment of children. NH 
has held the recognition for 
operating one of the World’s 
largest paediatric cardiac care 
unit in our flagship cardiac unit at 
Bengaluru, and with our Mumbai 
inroad, we intend to replicate that 
capability and offer affordable 
yet world-class medical care for 
infants, children and adolescents. 
The strong initial response from 
various stakeholders to SRCC 
Children’s Hospital, especially the 
doctor community, reinforces our 
belief about the strategy we have 
laid out there. 
The strategy is to create Mumbai 
region as a hub for the cluster and 
other facilities across the region to 
act as spokes to derive operational 
synergies harnessing cost efficiencies 
and shared resources. Novel 
approaches like operating the niche 
paediatric care hospital vindicates our 
well-calibrated expansion strategy.
NH prides itself in being one of the 
few hospital networks with a deep-
rooted penetration in the Eastern 
part of the country. We have nine 
hospitals, one heart centre and 
over 2,262 capacity beds and 1,983 
operational beds as on May 1, 2017. 
Our network of hospitals in the 
region includes hospitals in the 
greater Kolkata area encompassing 
Howrah, Barasat and the Eastern 
Metropolitan Bypass, a multispecialty 
hospital in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, a 
super speciality hospital in Guwahati, 
Assam and a managed hospital 
and heart centre in Durgapur. The 
eastern cluster contributes 36% 
to the hospital revenues and 38% 
to the hospital operational bed 
strength.

Our foray in the northern 
region is one of the vital 
developments of fiscal 
2016-17. At the beginning 
of 2016-17, we opened a 
super speciality hospital 
at Kakriyal in Jammu in 
partnership with Shri Mata 
Vaishno Devi Shrine Board. 
Located approximately 15 
kilometres from Katra, the 
base camp for tourists of 
Holy Shrine of Shri Mata 
Vaishno Devi, this ~230 
bedded tertiary care facility 
caters to patients across 20 
different specialities with a 
particular focus on cardiac

Management Discussion and Analysis
phenomenal response and 
the ramp up in the facility 
has happened quicker than 
the expected time. 
To further fortify our 
position in North India, NH 
entered into a partnership 
to provide healthcare 
services at ~300 capacity 
bedded Dharamshila 
Narayana Superspeciality 
Hospital & Research Centre 
in East Delhi and NH also 
acquired (Early 2017-18) a 
~230 bedded near complete 
hospital at Gurugram.
Dharamshila Hospital, 
presently an oncology-
focused unit, is in the 
process of getting 
upgraded to a state-of-the-
art super speciality tertiary 
care hospital. The hospital 
has a strong track record 
of operations over two 
decades and would give NH 
a robust platform to make 
significant inroads in the 
healthcare landscape of 
NCR. NH further bolstered 
its NCR presence by 
acquiring a near complete 
hospital. Located in 
South-Western part of 
NCR, it is the first hospital 
en route Gurugram 
from Indira Gandhi 
International Airport. This 
hospital would cement 
NH’s presence in North 
India by complementing 
the operations of East 
Delhi-based Dharamshila 
hospital and would help 
us in creating a strong 
regional network. 
The idea is to create a 
regional hub in NCR and tap 
into the northern region with 
vast potential. The emphasis 
is on minimizing the time 
to-market and leveraging 
the strong brand recognition 
NH enjoys in Karnataka 
and Eastern India to gain a 
significant head start in  
the region.

International Presence
Our laurel in the field of clinical 
excellence centred around affordability 
has surpassed the Indian shores 
helping us attract patients from Africa, 
Middle East and South Asian Nations. 
Today, we cater to patients from ~77 
countries. 
After attaining these prominent feats 
concerning international patients, 
we put to execution our frugal, yet 
innovative model to test at Cayman 
Islands. Started in 2013-14, Health City 
Cayman Islands (HCCI) was our first 
international venture in association 
with Ascension Health Alliance and 
Ascension Health Ventures, LLC. This 
facility has now emerged into advanced 
tertiary hospital and has expanded its 
service offerings through the programs 
of plastic surgery, interventional 
radiology and interventional neurology. 
This hospital pioneers in delivering 
high quality, affordable care and attract 
patients from the Cayman Islands, the 
Caribbean, the U.S, and Latin America. 
The facility, just a year after its opening, 
earned the prestigious Gold Seal 
of Approval from Joint Commission 
International (JCI), the worldwide leader 
in accrediting the quality of healthcare. 
HCCI is also the largest hospital in the 
Caribbean to be accredited by JCI. HCCI 
reported revenues of US$ 32.6 mn for 
twelve months ended March 2017. The 
facility broke even at the EBITDA level 
this fiscal and reported EBITDA of US$ 
2.5 mn reflecting an EBITDA margin of 
7.6% for the year. Achieving this within 
three years of operations highlights 
the strong operational performance 
of this facility. 
Last year, NH also inked a pact with 
prominent Kenyan doctors and a 
couple of international financial 
institutions to set up a healthcare 
facility in Nairobi, Kenya. 
The sheer success of our Cayman 
facility has lent us the confidence 
and understanding to operate in 
markets miles away from our home 
turf. This accomplishment has opened 
up frontiers of opportunities for 
us in international territories while 
we continue to expand in India. NH 
remains open to foray in select regions 
across Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle 
East and SAARC with limited capital 
exposure.

Group Operating Performance 
On operational front, year 2016-17 
was a momentous year for us. Group’s 
emphasis on a diverse case-mix with 
advanced high end-surgical work is 
reflected in our expanded services 
spectrum as the share of cardiac 
sciences in the group’s operating 
revenues has come down to ~48%, 
the first time in the history of our 
operations with core six specialities 
now contributing ~90% to revenues. 
The focal point of the strategy shifting 
towards other specialities, a part of 
our transformational journey to be 
recognised as a leading multi-speciality 
healthcare provider of choice across 
specialties, is also reflected in the 
stellar 18% growth in Average Revenue 
per Occupied Bed (ARPOB) of Rupees 
Seventy Six Lacs and sharp reduction 
of ~ 0.4 days in Average Length of Stay 
(ALOS) to 4.04 days. Another notable 
aspect of 2016-17 is the industry 
leading growth of 13% across our 
mature units notwithstanding their 
ageing profile along with a strong push 
from newer facilities which grew by 
25%. The group witnessed a growth 
in average occupied beds from 2,189 
beds* in 2015-16 to 2,255 beds* 
in 2016-17 despite the headwinds 
due to the demonetization drive 
which resulted in major disruption 
in the cash situation. Our focused 
initiatives along with NH’s strong 
brand recognition internationally 
resulted in a tremendous increase 
in international patients’ base whose 
share to operating revenues almost 
doubled from 4.5% in 2015-16 to 8.0% 
in 2016-17. One of the noteworthy 
highlights of 2016-17 is that our 
mature units continue to consistently 
display best-in-class profitability 
(EBITDAR) margins of over 25% even 
at less than 65% occupancy. All this 
was possible despite the government’s 
demonization initiative makes it a 
notable achievement.
The group improved its clinical 
performance by bringing in next 
generation medical technology like 
Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System to 
develop NH’s expertise in Minimal 
Invasive techniques which reduce 
surgical trauma to patients and patient 
recovery time. 
Rejig of the payer mix and continuous 
evaluation of operations enabled us 
improve our Debtor Sales Outstanding 
(DSO) from 39 days of Operating 
Income in 2015-16 to 33 days in 2016-
17. De-risking of the business model 
is underway and has started showing 
optimistic results as our reliance on 
three flag facilities has been come 
down to just over 50% of group’s 
operating revenues.
The other significant highlights of the 
operating performance are:
 NH launched a dedicated 30 bedded 
platinum wing in Mazumdar Shaw 
Medical Centre, Bengaluru to offer 
world-class services and comfort in 
line with international standards of 
dedicated care and hospitality 
 Department of Radiation Oncology 
at Narayana Superspeciality 
Hospital, Howrah completed its five 
years; it is the only department with 
modern radiotherapy facilities in the 
Howrah-Hooghly-Midnapore belt in 
West Bengal
 NH has partnered with Cisco to 
offer affordable remote diagnostic 
capabilities; this digital telemedicine 
solution would deliver advanced 
specialized healthcare services 
remotely in various parts of the 
country
 The Blood Bank at Guwahati 
Hospital got accredited by NABH, 
making it the first ever in the country 
to achieve this within 18 months of 
commissioning

Shareholders’ Funds
The movement in the shareholders’ 
funds from ` 8,763 mn as on March 
31, 2016 to ` 9,633 mn as on  March 
31, 2017 is explained in the below 
mentioned points:
Increase in the surplus on account 
of improved operating performance 
across the network of hospitals. “Total 
comprehensive income” stood at 830 
mn as compared to 200 mn in the 
previous year.
Liabilities
Long-Term Borrowings
The movement in the long-term 
borrowings from ` 1,876 mn as on 
March 31, 2016 to ` 1,798 mn as 
on March 31, 2017 is on account of 
routine principal repayments. 
Short-Term Borrowings 
The short-term borrowings have 
reduced by ` 356 mn from ` 446 mn 
in previous fiscal to ` 90 mn as on 
March 31, 2017. During the period, 
the Company repaid working capital 
loans to multiple banks on account of 
improved working capital management 
and also repaid commercial papers 
worth ` 200 mn backed by robust 
internal accruals.
Trade Payables 
The trade payables have increased 
from ` 1,610 mn in 2015-16 to ` 1,885 
mn in 2016-17 which is commensurate 
with the volume of business during 
the year. 
Other Current Financial Liabilities 
Increase in the creditors for capital 
goods by ` 176 mn essentially due 
to purchases of certain medical 
equipment in March 2017 across 
the network.
Assets
Gross Block
Gross Block (tangible assets) increased 
from ` 13,405 mn in 2015-16 to 
` 14,439 mn in 2016-17 reflecting 
an increase of ` 1,034 mn. Bulk of 
this increase is attributed towards 
strengthening the medical equipment 
base across our network. 
It is important to note that the Gross 
Block figures include cash and non-
cash Government Grant of ` 1,449 mn 
as per IND AS which was not a part of 
Gross block as per the previous IGAAP. 
As per the IND AS, a government grant 
may take the form of transfer of a non-
monetary asset such as land and other 
resources, for the use of the entity. 
In these circumstances, the fair value 
of non-monetary assets is assessed 
and both the grant and asset are 
accounted at that fair value. The impact 
of this grant is on account of land in 
Narayana Multispeciality Hospital, 
Jaipur, Narayana Multispeciality 
Hospital, Ahmedabad and building in 
Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, 
Guwahati. 
Non-Current Investments 
The movement of ~` 60 mn during 
2016-17 compared to 2015-16 is 
towards investments across our 
overseas ventures namely Kenya, 
Cayman Islands, etc. 
Inventories
The inventory has increased to 
` 524 mn in 2016-17 from ` 497 mn 
in the 2015-16. This nominal increase 
of ~5.4% in inventory compared 
with a major uptick of ~16.4% in 
operating revenues reflects company’s 
continuous evaluation of business 
operations. The optimisation is 
mainly on account of better inventory 
management and controls across 
hospitals. Setting up of warehouses 
across various locations to cater to 
their respective cluster hospitals has 
led to considerable reduction in stock 
holding and better fulfilment. 
Trade Receivables
The trade receivables (net of provisions 
for doubtful receivables) went up from 
` 1,518 mn in 2015-16 to ` 1,569 mn 
in 2016-17 reflecting an increase of 
~3.3% compared to ~16.4% increase in 
operating revenues. This considerably 
lower movement in trade receivables 
vis-à-vis operating revenues is on the 
back of company’s stringent financial 
controls and supply chain efficiency 
thus leading to reduction in the debtor 
days from in 35 days 2015-16 to 30 
days in 2016-17.  
Other Current Assets 
The other current assets have 
decreased from ` 240 mn to ` 199 
mn. This is on account of reduction in 
security deposit.

of phenomenal growth of 24.9% in 
the hospitals having maturity less 
than 5 years (including acquisitions) 
complemented by sustained, 
industry leading of 13.2% for the 
hospitals having maturity more than 
five years 
II. Improvement in the average 
realisation per operating bed 
(ARPOB) to ` 7.6 mn in 2016-17 
from ` 6.4 mn in 2015-16 on the 
back of improved case mix and 
due to reduction in ALOS as we are 
emphasising on short day surgeries 
and procedures
III. Increase in International patients’ 
share in revenues from 4.5% in 
2015-16 to 8.0% in 2016-17 
Cost of Material Consumed
The cost of material consumed 
(Purchase of medical consumables, 
drugs and surgical equipment and 
changes in inventories of medical 
consumables, drugs and surgical 
equipment) increased to ` 4,359 
mn from ` 3,871 mn. However, as a 
percentage to net sales, the cost of 
material consumed has come down 
to 23.2% in 2016-17 as compared to 
24.0% in the previous year. Increased 
yields through higher complexity 
of clinical work, better payor mix 
management along with economies 
of scale continue to result in achieving 
optimal consumption levels. 
Manpower Expenses (Employee 
Benefits + Prof. Fees paid to 
doctors)
The manpower expenses including 
professional fees paid to doctors have 
increased from ` 6,547 mn in 2015-16 
to ` 7,608 mn in 2016-17 in line with 
growth in business. 
Increase in payout to doctors is also 
on account of engagement of clinical 
talent at recently commissioned 
facilities at Jammu and Mumbai. There 
is an increase in employee cost due to 
investment in human resources across 
the board, in line with expanding 
operations and due to increase in the 
minimum wage paid to staff as per the 
government regulation. 
In addition, the Company had a non-
cash provisioning impact of ` 59 mn 
(` 34 mn in 2015-16) in 2016-17 due 
to outstanding employee stock 
options (ESOPs).
The uptick in revenues is a result of phenomenal growth 
of 24.9% in the hospitals having maturity less than 5 years 
(including acquisitions) complemented by sustained, 
industry leading of 13.2% for the hospitals having maturity 
more than five years.
Other Expenses (Excluding 
Professional Fees to Doctors)
The other expenses (excluding 
professional fees to doctors) of the 
Company at the consolidated level 
have increased by 13.9% to ` 4,526 
mn from ` 3,974 mn in the previous 
fiscal. Some of the key heads and the 
movement of expenses across each is 
explained below:
Repair and Maintenance 
The repair and maintenance expenses 
have increased from ` 691 mn in 
2015-16 to ` 754 mn in 2016-17. This 
increase is because of:
I. Increase in software maintenance 
costs, lift and other equipment 
II. Additional expenses on account of 
repair of medical equipment and 
medical accessories maintenance

Finance Cost
The finance cost on a year-on-year 
basis has reduced from ` 294 mn in 
2015-16 to ` 218 mn in 2016-17. This 
decrease is largely on account of the 
reduction in overall borrowings of 
the Company due to solid cash flow 
generation for the period under review 
coupled with a lower cost of borrowing.
Exceptional Items

is on account of loss of sale of our 
Berhampore unit. The Company

associated with all its business units.

and was at ` 830 mn in 2016-17 as

Hospital in Cayman Islands along with 
an improved EBITDA performance of 
the Company and its subsidiaries.

Advertisements

with expanding canvas of operations

While the overall power and fuel 
cost has increased from ` 472 mn in 
2015-16 to ` 499 mn in 2016-17, but

initiatives like cheaper renewable 
energy, efficient diesel powered 
equipment were undertaken across 
the network. 
Operating Rent

mn in 2015-16 to ` 482 mn. Operating 
rent as a percentage of operating 
revenues has come down from 3.1% 
in 2015-16 to 2.6% of total operational 
revenue in 2016-17. This decrease is 
due to buying back of certain medical 
equipment across our few facilities 
which were earlier under Pay Per Use 
model (PPU).

Depreciation and Amortization 
(EBITDA)
The Company reported an EBITDA of
