Company Overview
With “Healthcare for All, All for Healthcare” 
objective, NH started out on a mission in 
2000 to provide affordable healthcare 
across the spectrum of population. 
Patient-Centricity is deeply ingrained in 
the DNA of NH and this focus on patients’ 
requirements arising out of our strong 
understanding of patients’ needs helps 
us to be a true differentiator in the Indian 
healthcare landscape. With this goal in 
mind, we have been expanding in various 
regions which are of strategic interest  
to us. 
With Delhi NCR and Mumbai regions 
now a part of vibrant NH umbrella, we 
have projected ourselves as a Pan-India 
healthcare provider. As of 1st May 2018, 
NH operates 24 hospitals, 7 heart centres 
and 19 primary care facilities and a multi-
speciality hospital in Cayman Islands 
adding up to 6,232 operational beds and 
7,273 capacity beds. 
With dominance in southern, eastern 
clusters and emerging presence in 
northern and western regions, NH is 
progressing along to be a true Pan-
India 
healthcare 
provider. 
Recent 
commissioning of Gurugram Hospital 
coupled 
with 
transformation 
of 
Dharamshila Cancer Care Unit to a 
tertiary multi-speciality hospital will play 
a crucial role in evolution of the northern 
cluster which already has our Jammu 
unit operational for almost 2 years. 
The strategic location of our Gurugram 
facility supplemented by state-of-the-
art medical technology deployed there 
makes it an ideal fit for patients looking 
out for premium healthcare services with 
an element of affordability. 
Narrowing down to fiscal year 2018, we 
are pleased to report remarkable results 
both on financial and operational front. 
At the consolidated level, the Company 
reported an industry leading, impressive 
growth of ~21%. On the profitability front, 
we are delighted with the performance 
as it has been achieved with our newly 
commissioned facilities just in their first 
year of operation. Business was also 
impacted by price cap on cardiac stents, 
knee implants and introduction of GST. 
Notwithstanding the impact of these 
transient ripples, profitability margins are 
quite impressive highlighting the NH’s 
growth story. 
Delving into international operations, 
we started Cayman Islands Hospital  
with the idea of providing world-
class tertiary care to the historically 
underserved Caribbean market. We are 
proud today that our strategy of offering 
high quality and affordable care has 
brought great success and recognition 
across the region. Cayman Islands unit 
registered a revenue growth of ~37% 
YoY with a phenomenal (FY15-FY18) 
CAGR of ~79% and EBITDA margin of 
~14% in FY18. This unit’s capability of 
attracting patients across the Caribbean  
region could be a game changer for NH. 
With Cayman’s success, we continue 
to 
scout 
for 
opportunities 
globally 
which could create a synergistic impact 
with a well laid-out strategy which 
limits our capital outlay coupled with  
frugal innovation in operations and 
supply chains. 
It is really a feather in our cap when  
it comes to clinical expertise, we  
continue to take challenging medical 
cases 
and 
register 
best-in-class 
clinical outcomes so as to be a great  
medial institution.
Some of our achievements in clinical excellence are highlighted below:

Business Review 
More than 5 years’ bucket
NH’s matured facilities continue to shine and this is evident from the fact that 
they have delivered revenue growth of ~12% on a year-on-year basis. The ability 
to consistently translate this high revenue growth into best-in-class EBITDAR 
margins of ~22% speaks volumes of our operational excellence, achieved 
over the years. This bucket continues to register healthy average realisations 
which are at ~` 8.0 mn with an average occupancy of 65% signalling a large 
scope for ramp-up. 
The Three Firmest Pillars of NH 
MSMC, housed in Health City, Bengaluru 
driven by tertiary and quaternary services 
such 
as 
Bone 
Marrow 
Transplant, 
introduction of Da Vinci Robotics, grew 
at a stupendous 20%. Its sister facility 
i.e. NICS, Bengaluru registered an 
impressive 12% growth, despite being a 
clinical behemoth in terms of sheer size 
and number of beds catering to just one 
speciality i.e. Cardiac Sciences. 
Yet again this year, RTIICS Kolkata 
operated 
at 
the 
highest 
levels 
of  
occupancy (~85%). This accomplishment, 
despite the challenging and unpredictable 
regulatory regime in West Bengal points 
towards the eminent stature RTIICS has 
gained over the years. This is testament to 
the faith of people in NH’s capabilities to 
provide quality healthcare services.
Clinical Intervention-led Growth 
Close to 7-year-old facility, Raipur though 
started slowly but has picked-up nicely 
over the past 3-4 years. With partner’s 
investment in civil infrastructure and our 
investment in medical equipment, we 
are aiming to commission a radiation 
oncology block this fiscal. It is heartening 
to say that our Mysore unit has received 
very strong patient traction since its 
inception and to cater to the burgeoning 
patients’ needs, we have started civil 
work on putting-up a new block. At our 
Jaipur unit, we are in the process of 
commissioning a radiation oncology 
block.

3-5 years’ bucket
While NH’s performance is centred around its matured facilities, but the younger 
set of hospitals such as facilities in Guwahati, HSR and Whitefield have also 
shown promising results by growing at impressive rates on a year-on-year 
basis. The pace of ramp-up and profitability at these units is something we 
did not envision at the onset of operations. With increase in occupancy levels, 
supported by inherent operating leverage, we expect 8.4% EBITDAR margins 
in FY18 of this bucket to converge to those registered by our matured facilities. 
With this bucket inching towards matured operations along with a strong brand 
pull, the hospitals in this category enjoy in their respective regions, average 
realisations are at ` 9.5 mn and occupancy at 57%.
Tailor-made Approach towards 
Payee Profile 
We have restructured operations at our 
HSR unit a bit in line with a secondary 
neighbourhood hospital. Our Whitefield 
facility, being present in a highly affluent 
region, is amongst the highest ARPOB 
units of our network with ARPOB 
surpassing ` 10 mn. We continue to 
remain bullish on it going forward and are 
in advanced stages of capacity expansion 
by setting up 150-bedded new block.
Less than 3 years’ bucket
This bucket houses our newest additions to the NH’s vibrant umbrella of 
operations. It includes our unit up north in Jammu which is now a 2-years-old 
facility along with our one of its kind recently commissioned children-only facility 
in Mumbai and a recently commissioned multispeciality facility in Gurugram.
Budding Facilities but Promising 
Signs of Growth 
Though the hospitals in this category 
are still in nascent stages of their 
operational life-cycle but the fact that 
NH has managed to penetrate two of 
the most affluent markets of Delhi NCR 
and Mumbai highlights the importance 
of existence of these hospitals. The 
response till date has been quite 
phenomenal due to their prime locations, 
catering to large catchment areas and 
affluent payee profile. 
We expect SRCC Mumbai, one of its kind 
Children-only facility, to take the normal 
time for ramping up, but cardiac services 
department has shown healthy signs of 
traction led by our tie-up with the Assam 
Government. Through government and 
institutional associations, we are working 
on treating patients in other specialties 
as well. Cases such as our hospital 
in Mumbai performed Extracorporeal 
Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) on 
a little girl suffering from H1N1 and 
severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, 
the procedure being first of its kind in a 
paediatric case in Mumbai, highlights the 
clinical expertise we have.
Our Jammu facility, despite being in 
challenging terrain, is growing at a healthy 
rate and has shown strong occupancy 
ramp-up. 
Our recently commissioned multispeciality 
hospital in Gurugram which is in close 
proximity to Indira Gandhi International 
Airport, New Delhi will leverage on 
India’s 
burgeoning 
medical 
tourism 
industry and thus attract international 
patients. Its world-class medical and civil 
infrastructure buoyed by the best clinical 
talent will act as an enabling force to help 
strengthen NH its footprints in the region.

Acquired Operations 
Inorganic route has remained an important pillar of NH’s growth and this bodes 
well by the fact that this bucket currently comprises ~15% of group’s total 
hospital operational beds and ~13% of total hospital revenues. By gaining 
access to these operational facilities, we managed to minimise the time-to-
market and gain significant head start in respective geographies, which is not 
the case in greenfield projects. 
 Growing Eminence in Eastern 
India 
 
In FY 2013-14, NH added Westbank 
units to its network with an aim to 
gain greater foothold in Eastern India, 
centred around Kolkata. Since then, 
Westbank has evolved as a Centre of 
Excellence and a leading Oncology 
player in Eastern India. Buoyed 
by the strong patients’ response 
from neighbouring areas including 
Bangladesh, we commissioned 2nd 
LINAC at Westbank in June 2017. 
 NH 
Projects 
itself 
on 
the 
Country Map 
 
Before 
forging 
partnership 
with 
Dharamshila Cancer Foundation and 
Research Centre, NH’s presence in 
Northern India was limited only to 
Jammu. Having already expanded 
service 
offerings 
at 
Dharamshila 
facility 
to 
include 
Orthopaedics, 
Neuro Surgery, Nephrology, Kidney 
Transplant, Urology, GI Sciences, we 
are progressing well on transforming 
this Oncology focussed unit, with 
strong track record of close to two 
decades, into a multispeciality hospital. 
This is also in line with our business 
model to de-risk our business from 
single-speciality. 
Besides these hospitals, we also operate 
7 heart centres and 19 primary healthcare 
facilities. Our clinic in Langford Town, 
Bengaluru is the latest entrant in our 
network. Equipped with most of the 
Lab & Diagnostics equipment such 
as X-RAY, ECG, TMT, ECHO, EEG & 
USG, this hybrid clinic provides service 
offerings ranging from OPD consultation 
to day care services such as dialysis, 
chemotherapy, endoscopy etc. This clinic 
predominantly caters to high income 
group population in upmarket residential 
locality of Bengaluru. We expect this 
facility to emerge as an important referral 
point for our Health City, Bengaluru. 
The 
successful 
operations 
across 
categories encourage us to work hard 
even more and continuously explore new 
avenues to achieve the goal of becoming 
a 
preferred 
healthcare 
partner 
for 
patients, doctors, insurance company, 
government establishments etc.

Operating Performance 
Fiscal year 2018 was a noteworthy year 
for us on multiple counts. From expanding 
our reach in northern and western clusters 
to increasing our stake to 100% in Cayman 
Islands Hospital, it has been a year filled 
with key milestones. With the expansion 
exercise under the theme “unfolding 
India’s play”, recent commissioning of 
our Gurugram hospital has added the 
necessary muscle to our budding northern 
cluster and is anticipated to leverage on 
the operational synergies to be created 
by it being in proximity to Dharamshila 
Hospital. 
Our de-risking exercise centred around 
decreasing 
our 
reliance 
on 
three 
flagship facilities has been tremendously 
successful, as for the first time ever, their 
contribution to the group’s revenues has 
come down below ~50% in Q4 FY18. 
Our endeavours to project ourselves as 
a multi-speciality health provider has 
resulted in strengthening of other pillars 
of strength apart from cardiac sciences 
which now accounts for ~42% from 
~55% in 2015 with other specialities 
catching up such as gastro sciences now 
at 15%, oncology now contribute~10% 
with neuro sciences and renal sciences 
not far behind at 8% and 8% respectively. 
This strategy of creating Centre of 
Excellences around other specialities 
and emphasising on advanced medical 
care along with tapping the international 
lucrative patients’ base resulted in 
improvement in realisations which led to 
ARPOB at ` 8.0 mn in FY18 from ` 5.8 
mn in FY15. 
The group witnessed a strong uptick in 
average occupied beds at 2,725 in FY18 
majorly due to the expansion exercise 
we undertook in North and West India 
along with strong occupancy ramp-up 
across our other network hospitals. With 
attracting international patients in the 
network on the radar for quite sometime, 
we are pleased with the progress this 
payor category has reported with ~10% 
contribution to revenues.

As on May 1st 2018, we operate 24 hospitals in India.

NH India Balance Sheet 
Review
Long -Term Borrowings
The movement in the Long-Term Borrowing 
of the company from `1,798 mn to `4,940 
mn is on account of funding the Gurugram 
transaction wherein we acquired a near 
complete hospital in Gurugram, funding of 
the Cayman Islands’ transaction in which 
we acquired the entire partner’s stake in 
HCCI. These transactions were a part of 
a well-thought through exercise aimed 
at expanding into crucial market of Delhi 
NCR which is termed as India’s medical 
tourism hub and Cayman transaction is a 
part of global ambition to project NH as an 
international brand. 
Short-Term Borrowings
The 
short-term 
borrowings 
have 
increased from `90 mn in 2016-17 to `376 
mn in 2017-18. This increase was due to 
meet the short-term capital commitments 
of the Company. 
Trade Payables
The trade payables have increased from 
` 2,066 mn in 2016-17 to ` 2,692 mn in 
2017-18 due to increase in the volume 
of business done during the year as the 
growth in revenues was quite robust in 
2017-18 over the last year.
Assets
Gross Tangible Assets
Gross Tangible Assets increased from 
` 14,439 mn in 2016-17 to ` 18,538 mn in 
2017-18. Bulk of this increase is attributed 
towards addition of new facilities to the 
group’s umbrella i.e. commissioning 
of facilities in Delhi NCR and Mumbai, 
strengthening the medical equipment 
base across our network. 
It is important to note that the Gross 
Block figures include cash and non-cash 
Government Grant of ~`1,500 mn as 
per Ind AS which was not a part of Gross 
block as per the previous IGAAP. Also, as 
per the Ind AS accounting, the overtaking 
the operations of Dharamshila Cancer 
Care Hospital has led to creation of non-
cash lease provision of `1,062 mn which 
has further bloated up the Gross Block. 
As per the IND AS, a government grant 
may take the form of transfer of a non-
monetary asset such as land and other 
resources, for the use of the entity. In 
these circumstances, the fair value of 
non-monetary assets is assessed, and 
both the grant and asset are accounted 
at that fair value. The impact of this 
grant is on account of land in Narayana 
Multispeciality Hospital, Jaipur, Narayana 
Multispeciality Hospital, Ahmedabad and 
building in Narayana Superspeciality 
Hospital, Guwahati.
Trade Receivables
The trade receivables (net of provision for 
doubtful receivables) went up from `1,569 
mn last year to `2,219 mn in 2017-18. 
This increase in the receivables is mainly 
on account of increase in revenues of the 
Company over the last year and some 
part of the increase in receivables is also 
attributed to delay in payments related to 
certain government schemes. 
Inventories
The inventory has increased from ` 524 
mn last year to ` 588 mn. This nominal 
increase of ~12% in inventory compared 
to a major uptick of ~17% in revenues 
reflects the Company’s efficient supply 
chain 
management. 
Setting 
up 
of 
warehouses across the country to cater 
to needs of the facilities in their respective 
regions has turned out to be quite 
effective in managing the inventories at 
optimal level.

NH India P&L Review
Operating Income:
The Company’ revenue from operations 
increased from 18,782 mn in 2016-17 to 
22,039 mn in 2017-18. This increase of 
17.3% is due to:
Sustained 
performance 
of 
matured 
centres which increased from ` 482 mn 
to ` 581 mn with Health City, Bengaluru 
growing at 16% along with a robust 
performance of less than 5 years’ centres 
(Excluding recently commissioned units) 
which grew by ~24%.
Commissioning of new hospitals in 
Delhi NCR and Mumbai i.e. Dharamshila 
Multispeciality Hospital in Delhi and 
SRCC children’s Hospital in Mumbai 
which also added to group revenues.
Cost of Material Consumed
The cost of material consumed (purchase 
of medical consumables, drugs and 
surgical equipment and changes in 
inventories of medical consumables, drugs 
and surgical equipment) increased to 
` 5,407 mn in 2017-18 from ` 4,359 mn last 
year. The major reasons for the same are:
Introduction of GST during FY18 led to 
an increase in cost of medicines and 
consumables.
Robust increase in revenues due to strong 
patients’ footfall across the network.
Capping of prices of cardiac stents led 
to a decrease in stent realisation and

Manpower Expenses (Employees 
Benefits + Prof. Fees paid to 
Doctors)
The 
manpower 
expenses 
including 
professional fees paid to doctors have 
increased from ` 7,608 mn in 2016-17 
to ` 9,127 mn in 2017-18. This absolute 
increase is majorly due to hiring of clinical 
talent across our recently commissioned 
facilities at Delhi NCR and Mumbai. 
Increase in headcount at the corporate 
level and unit level also attributed to an 
increase in manpower cost.
In addition, the Company had a non-cash 
provisioning impact of ` 42 mn in 2017-
18 due to outstanding employee stock 
options (ESOPs).
Other Expenses 
The 
other 
expenses 
(excluding 
professional fees to doctors) of the 
Company at the India business level have 
increased to ` 5,492 mn from ` 4,526 mn 
in the previous fiscal. Some of the key 
heads and the movement of expenses 
across each is explained below:
Operating Rent 
The operating rent increased from `482 
mn in 2016-17 (2.6% of total operational 
revenue) to ` 582 mn (2.6% of total 
operational revenue) in 2017-18. The 
absolute increase in operating rent is due 
to rentals associated with commissioning 
of new centres such as a clinic at

Statutory reportS
FinanCial StatementS
Langford Town, Bengaluru and setting up 
of an international wing in Healthy City, 
Bengaluru. However, operating rent as a 
% of revenues remains unchanged due 
to strong increase in revenues over the 
last year.
Repair and Maintenance 
The repair and maintenance expenses 
have increased from ` 754 mn in 2016-
17 to ` 950 mn in 2017-18. This increase 
is because of cost incurred in regard 
to MEP and IT infrastructure at newly 
commissioned facilities at Delhi NCR 
and Mumbai and clinic at Langford Town, 
Bengaluru as well as maintenance of our 
existing facilities.
Power and Fuel 
The overall power and fuel cost has 
increased from ` 499 mn in 2016-17 to 
` 629 mn in 2017-18. This is primarily 
due to increase in electricity consumption 
because of commissioning of new facilities 
in Mumbai, Delhi NCR and a new clinic in 
Langford, Bengaluru along with increased 
consumption across the network due to 
increase in occupied beds in FY18. 
Business Promotion and 
Advertisements
These expenses were at ` 765 mn for 
2017-18. This cost continues to grow with 
expansion of NH’s network.
 Advertisements and publicity cost 
increased from ` 375 mn in 2016-
17 to ` 469 mn in 2017-18 due to 
promotion exercise we undertook as 
we commissioned facilities in Mumbai, 
Delhi NCR and a clinic in Langford 
town in Bengaluru.
 Business 
Promotion 
increased 
from `173 mn in 2016-17 to `296 
mn in 2017-18 due to setting up of 
a call centre to facilitate booking 
the 
consultation 
appointments 
at the network level, increase in 
international promotional expenses 
to tap more international patients into 
NH network.
EBITDA
The Company registered an EBITDA 
of `2,200 mn in FY 2017-18 for its 
India business. The dip in profitability 
is majorly on account of operational/
pre-commissioning losses associated 
with our newly commissioned facilities. 
These facilities in Delhi NCR and 
Mumbai together contributed to losses 
worth ` 405 mn. Additionally, capping 
on cardiac stent prices impacted 
our revenues which led to directly 
impacting the EBITDA significantly. 
Introduction of GST also increased our 
cost leading to downward pressure on 
the profitability. 
Finance Cost
NH enjoys the best-in class commercials on 
loans and borrowings from various banks. 
Increase in Finance cost is attributed to the 
spike in net debt of the Company. 
The debt increased due to funding of 
the Gurugram transaction where in the 
company acquired a near complete ~200 
capacity-bedded hospital in Gurugram 
leading to higher finance cost.
Finance cost as also increased due 
to Ind AS adjustment as per which 
the Company has recorded a finance 
lease liability in regard to the overtaking 
operations of the Dharamshala Cancer 
Care Hospital in Delhi. It is not actually an 
interest expense but a significant portion 
of rentals which we pay to our partner as 
per our agreement.
A part of finance cost is also attributed 
to NH India having US$ 25 mn of debt 
on its books in regard to the Cayman 
Islands’ transaction we consummated 
during FY18. This debt is US dollar 
denominated and has come at very 
attractive commercials.
